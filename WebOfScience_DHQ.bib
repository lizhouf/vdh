   Measures}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{The present paper addresses the problem of literary history as a problem
   of data comprehensiveness and selection, seeking not to resolve the
   impossibility of literary historical narrative, but to reframe it
   through a computational perspective. Our focus is on the Quan Tang shi
   (Complete Tang poetry), the massive comprehensive anthology of Tang
   poetry that was produced at the height of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912).
   The sheer quantity of Tang poetry preserved in the Quan Tang shi (over
   50,000 poems and poem fragments) exceeds the human-scale perspectives of
   close reading. To make sense of the corpus as a whole, we will show how
   two related forms of distant reading - topic modeling and divergence
   measures - allow us to reframe and rethink these literary historical
   questions and provide a new perspective on what it means to read Tang
   poetry.}},

Title = {{Decoupling Quality Control and Publication: The Digital Latin Library
   and the Traveling Imprimatur}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{With The Library of Digital Latin Texts (LDLT), the Digital Latin
   Library (DLL) is set to publish critical editions as sets of data
   independent of a presentational format. These datasets are meant to be
   reused for a variety of purposes and in a variety of presentational
   formats, including the DLL's own user edition viewer and data
   visualization applications. It is thus vital to have a way of certifying
   the data as published in accordance with the DLL's policies and
   procedures, central to which are its provisions for peer review.
   Accordingly, to facilitate the use of an edition's data in different
   settings, and to promote a high degree of confidence in the quality of
   the data, we have introduced the DLL Review Registry Service. The DLL
   Review Registry Service offers a way of associating peer reviewed status
   with the text data rather than within any particularly visualization of
   that data. Any visualization of text data can consult this service and
   discover whether or not this data has been reviewed. In this way, we
   free the ``imprimatur{''} from its association with any particular
   presentation and allow the indicators of quality to ``travel{''} with
   the data and be communicated to end users in a plurality of
   visualizations.}},

Abstract = {{To examine changes in the diversity of popular songs over time, I have
   analyzed the lyrics of 99\% of all songs sung in English that have
   appeared on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart from 1956 up to and
   including 2016 (n=27.108). I have found the number of songs that reached
   the Hot 100 per year more than halved between 1966 and 2002, which
   indicates a loss in diversity. I have also found that the variation of
   valence (or level of pleasantness) in the songs' lyrics and the
   variation of a sampled Type Token ratio (an indicator for lexical
   complexity) decreases over time. This indicates that lyrics of popular
   songs become more similar and again signify a loss of diversity.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Skillful identification and interpretation of arguments is a cornerstone
   of learning, scholarly activity and thoughtful civic engagement. These
   are difficult skills for people to learn, and they are beyond the reach
   of current computational methods from artificial intelligence and
   machine learning, despite hype suggesting the contrary. In previous
   work, we have attempted to build systems that scaffold these skills in
   people. In this paper we reflect on the difficulties posed by this work,
   and we argue that it is a serious challenge which ought to be taken up
   within the digital humanities and related efforts to computationally
   support scholarly practice. Network analysis, bibliometrics, and
   stylometrics, essentially leave out the fundamental humanistic skill of
   charitable argument interpretation because they touch very little on the
   meanings embedded in texts. We present a problematisation of the design
   space for potential tool development, as a result of insights about the
   nature and form of arguments in historical texts gained from our attempt
   to locate and map the arguments in one corner of the Hathi Trust digital
   library.}},

   that digital rhetors and authors should seek to use the affordances of
   technology to bring the virtual and the real together to create reality
   altering experiences that are persuasive and transductive. This book is
   an invaluable tool for those new to the digital humanities as well as

Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{The present study will investigate the perceptions of information
   professionals about their role in the work of digital humanities
   scholars, as well as the perceptions of digital humanities scholars on
   the role of information professionals in their research. While other
   scholarly literature has considered collaborations between these groups
   via surveys or interviews with small project teams, the present study
   will provide a large-scale analysis of collaborations using survey
   responses from more than 500 scholars, librarians, and archivists.
   Questions sought to determine the extent to which these groups
   collaborate with one another on project teams; how these collaborations
   unfold and who initiates them; whether IPs have begun to adjust and
   adapt their work to support specific DH projects, or to make their
   content more appealing and easy for potential future DH projects; and
   what administrative hurdles are faced during the collaboration. The
   survey also address how information professionals and DH scholars view
   the success of the collaboration after completing their work, and
   whether they intend to collaborate in future. To conclude, the article
   will consider what these responses tell us about how best to support all
   members of these collaborations.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the work to date on Music Scholarship Online
   (MuSO), an online research environment for digitized and born-digital
   music resources that inscribes itself within the federated model of the
   Advanced Research Consortium (ARC). With the project now in its third
   year, MuSO has reached an inflection point where it has developed a
   music-centered RDF schema and demonstrated the potential for federated
   searching across ARC nodes by crosswalking eighteenth-century music
   content from Europeana into ARC. The case study presented here outlines
   the dissemination role that MuSO proposes to play within the music
   research community, the history of MuSO in relation to ARC, the
   Europeana test case, and future steps for the continued development of
   MuSO. By facilitating the discovery of digital music content, and
   providing a virtual environment for music researchers, MuSO will promote
   data reuse, strengthen community standards in music representation, and
   create possibilities for cross-disciplinary exchange. We propose that by
   leveraging the connections between digital music resources and digital
   humanities research technologies, MuSO will facilitate new research that
   expands the musicological discipline.}},

Title = {{Modelling Medieval Hands: Practical OCR for Caroline Minuscule}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Over the past few decades, the ever-expanding media of the digital
   world, including digital humanities endeavors, have become more reliant
   on the results of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software. Yet,
   unfortunately, medievalists have not had as much success with using OCR
   software on handwritten manuscripts as scholars using printed books as
   their sources. While some projects to ameliorate this situation have
   emerged in recent years, using software to create machine-readable
   results from medieval manuscripts is still in its infancy. This article
   presents the results of a series of successful experiments with open
   source neural network OCR software on medieval manuscripts. Results over
   the course of these experiments yielded character and word accuracy
   rates over 90\%, reaching 94\% and 97\% accuracy in some instances. Such
   results are not only viable for creating machine-readable texts but also
   pose new avenues for bringing together manuscript studies and digital
   humanities in ways previously unrealized. A closer examination of the
   experiments indicates regular patterns among the OCR results that could
   potentially allow for use cases beyond pure text recognition, such as
   for paleographic classifications of script types.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores different ways of modelling and simulating complex
   spatial and temporal events, such as battles, for which it has been
   practically impossible to (re)construct the thousands if not hundreds of
   thousands of variables of which they are comprised. This research
   utilises as a case study the Battle of Mount Street Bridge of the Irish
   Easter 1916 Rising, in which the number of British casualties has been
   fiercely debated. The research is framed within the theory and practice
   of digital scholarly editions, which provides a new paradigm for
   approaching virtual worlds in a contextualized and annotated
   environment. This paper also discusses the challenges of creating
   virtual worlds for online environments in which there is rapid
   obsolescence of software and platforms and an absence of standards.}},

Title = {{Managing 100 Digital Humanities Projects: Digital Scholarship \&
   Archiving in King's Digital Lab}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{During the 2016-2017 financial year, King's Digital Lab (King's College
   London) undertook an extensive archiving and sustainability project to
   ensure the ongoing management, security, and sustainability of similar
   to 100 digital humanities projects, produced over a twenty-year period.
   Many of these projects, including seminal publications such as
   Aphrodisias in Late Antiquity, Inscriptions of Roman Tripolitania, Henry
   Ill Fine Rolls, Jonathan Swift Archive, Jane Austen Manuscripts, The
   Gascon Rolls, The Gough Map, and Inquisitions Post Mortem, occupy
   important positions in the history of digital humanities. Of the
   projects inherited by the lab, about half are either of exceptionally
   high quality or seminal in other ways but almost all of them struggled
   with funding and technical issues that threatened their survival. By
   taking a holistic approach to infrastructure, and software engineering
   and maintenance, the lab has resolved the majority of the issues and
   secured the short to medium term future of the projects in its care.
   This article details the conceptual, procedural, and technical
   approaches used to achieve that, and offers policy recommendations to
   prevent repetition of the situation in the future.}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{FemTechNet is a relatively small and loosely affiliated feminist,
   anti-racist collective which focuses on overlaps between and
   implications of feminism and technology. It exists as a support and
   collaboration structure that challenges traditional hierarchies through
   distributed power and collective creation. In an examination of hidden
   labor and archival silences, this research addresses how ideological
   underpinnings shaped the process of envisioning an institutional archive
   of FemTechNet records, how principles held by FemTechNet reverberated
   through the archival process, and how FemTechNet members conceptualized
   the imagined institutionally-held archive. The research reveals that the
   collective navigated institutional requirements and resources, the risks
   inherent in the tensions between the personal and the collective, and
   affective presence as part of the creation of the records that form the
   archive.}},

Abstract = {{In this article I call for more recognition of and scholarly engagement
   with public, volunteer digital humanities projects, using the example of
   LibriVox.org to consider what public, sustainable, digital humanities
   work can look like beyond the contexts of institutional sponsorship.
   Thousands of volunteers are using LibriVox to collaboratively produce
   free audiobook versions of texts in the US public domain. The work of
   finding, selecting, and preparing texts to be digitized and published in
   audio form is complex and slow, and not all of this labor is ultimately
   visible, valued, or rewarded. Drawing on an ethnographic study of 12
   years of archived discourse and documentation, I interrogate digital
   traces of the processes by which several LibriVox versions of Anne of
   Green Gables have come into being, watching for ways in which policies
   and infrastructure have been influenced by variously visible and
   invisible forms of work. Making visible the intricate, unique, archived
   experiences of the crowdsourcing community of LibriVox volunteers and
   their tools adds to still-emerging discussions about how to value
   extra-institutional, public, distributed digital humanities work.}},

Abstract = {{The work of digital humanists and librarians is often invisible to the
   larger communities in which they work, particularly in academia. This
   opinion essay by three librarian-scholar-digital practitioners explores
   invisible work and life on the hyphen - between the academy and the
   library and between the human and the digital. In this essay, we
   illustrate how librarian-scholar-digital practitioners can feel
   overworked and underappreciated, working in and with multiple fields and
   communities who have different and sometimes competing methodologies.
   Through two examples, we look at how living on the hyphen takes its toll
   for librarian-scholar-digital practitioners. We end our essay by
   detailing steps faculty and administration can take to help us solve the
   problem and realize the promise of digital humanities.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2019}},

Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Academic libraries have an important role to play in supporting digital
   humanities projects in their communities. Librarians at Stony Brook
   University Libraries host Open Mic events for digital humanities
   researchers, teachers, and students on campus. Inspired by a desire to
   better serve digital humanists with existing projects, this event was
   initially organized to increase the visibility of scholars and students
   with nascent projects and connect these digital humanists to library
   supported resources and to one another. For the Libraries, the Open Mic
   was an opportunity to understand the scope and practices of the digital
   humanities community at Stony Brook, and to identify ways to make
   meaningful interventions. An open mic is a uniquely suitable event
   format in that it embodies a dynamic, permissive, multidisciplinary
   presentation space that is as much for exercising new and ongoing
   research (and technologies) as it is for making discoveries and
   connections. The success of these events can be measured in the
   establishment of the University Libraries as a nexus for digital
   humanities work, consultations, instruction, workshops, and community on
   a campus without a designated digital humanities center. The digital
   humanities Open Mic event at Stony Brook University locates the digital
   humanities within the library's repertoire, while signaling that the
   library is - in a number of essential ways - open.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{This short essay describes the difficulties and impromptu workarounds
   that emerged when using the video game ``Minecraft{''} as the central
   teaching tool in several professional writing seminars. More
   specifically, the author discusses a key moment in the semester where
   students needed to move between university and non-university technology
   infrastructures in order to create multiplayer gamespaces that were
   accessible to their peers. In narrating this experience, the author will
   demonstrate how a discourse of ``access{''} can be used to examine the
   oft-invisible policies, procedures, and restrictions that shape the way
   we compose, circulate and make visible digitally-native work.
   Furthermore, the author will discuss how a critical emphasis on
   ``access{''} can help teachers and students better mediate the
   relationship between internal or university-supplied technological
   infrastructures and external platforms when creating interactive digital
   projects.
   The underlying motivation of this essay is not to lambaste universities
   for lack of institutional support nor is it to champion commercial
   organizations as saviors for helping teachers successfully use digital
   platforms in the classroom. Instead, the goal of this brief essay is to
   spur discussions surrounding the following questions: how might we use
   issues regarding access to better examine and navigate the
   hard-to-define boundaries that separate university-sanction technology
   use from non-university sanctioned technology use? How might calling
   students' attention to access refine the larger learning objectives for
   Digital Humanities or DH-related courses?}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{This article illuminates the ways that digital humanities labs might
   foster experiences for graduate students that fulfill what Alexander
   Reid (2002) postulates as the ``central task{''} of the digital
   humanities graduate education. We argue that while the digital
   humanities lab as an institutional economic model does not necessarily
   promote a focus on graduate student professionalization, it uniquely has
   the capacity to push back against competing discourses of neoliberal
   vocationalism, funding and labor precarity on one hand, and
   technological utopianism and tool fetishization on the other, to train
   students agile, contextual, and rhetorical mindsets with which to enter
   technologically-mediated workplaces and lives. To begin, we review the
   discussion of digital humanities labs in the literature: digital
   humanities institutional models, how these models are practiced, lab
   funding, and the resultant position of labs as sites of training for
   graduate students. From there, we offer a teaching case from the Lab's
   fall 2015 ``Stories from Data{''} workshop in order to render visible a
   set of principles to guide professionalization of graduate students in
   the digital humanities lab. We conclude with reflections on how these
   principles might alter current discussions of the success or failure of
   the Mellon Foundation and NEH ODH digital humanities funding initiatives
   in the United States.}},

Title = {{Building Pedagogy into Project Development: Making Data Construction
   Visible in Digital Projects}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{This essay responds to two questions at the heart of the Invisible Labor
   in the Digital Humanities 2016 symposium at Florida State University:
   (1) what is at stake in making unseen work visible, and (2) how can DH
   projects equally distribute and value the labor involved in their
   construction? For us, the answer to these questions lies in privileging
   the pedagogical affordances of data construction by crafting a workflow
   that included undergraduates as intellectual partners, and using DH
   methods to visualize and make public this collaborative labor. By
   drawing on our work with Photogrammar, which visualizes federal New Deal
   documentary projects including photography and life histories, we
   highlight three strategies for making labor visible in the digital
   humanities. First, we discuss how this project served as a tool for
   teaching undergraduate students key methods in DH by giving them
   experience with conducting original research with credit on the public
   site. In this way, we explain how pedagogy can become a part of project
   development. Second, we argue that DH visualization techniques can make
   the labor behind DH projects visible. We focus on how Photogrammar uses
   a timeline and network analysis alongside the traditional ``About{''}
   page to make visible all participants in the project. Third, we turn to
   an open discussion of the challenges faced in the politics of
   attribution when working with university, governmental and private
   historical organizations, including domain names and the use of
   organizational logos.}},

Title = {{Manual Annotation of Unsupervised Models: Close and Distant Reading of
   Politics on Reddit}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This article offers a methodological contribution to manually-assisted
   topic modeling. With the availability of vast amounts of (online) texts,
   performing full scale literary analysis using a close reading approach
   is not practically feasible. The set of alternatives proposed by Franco
   Moretti (2000) under the umbrella term of ``distant reading{''} aims to
   show broad patterns that can be found throughout the entire text
   collection. After a survey of literary-critical practices that combine
   close and distant reading methods, we use manual annotations of a thread
   on Reddit, both to evaluate an LDA model, and to provide information
   that topic modeling lacks. We also make a case for applying these
   reading techniques that originate in literary reading more broadly to
   online, non-literary contexts. Given a large collection of posts from a
   Reddit thread, we compare a manual, close reading analysis against an
   automatic, computational distant reading approach based on topic
   modeling using LDA. For each text in the collection, we label the
   contents, effectively clustering related texts. Next, we evaluate the
   similarity of the respective outcomes of the two approaches. Our results
   show that the computational content/topic-based labeling partially
   overlaps with the manual annotation. However, the close reading approach
   not only identifies texts with similar content, but also those with
   similar function. The differences in annotation approaches require
   rethinking the purpose of computational techniques in reading analysis.
   Thus, we present a model that could be valuable for scholars who have a
   small amount of manual annotation that could be used to tune an
   unsupervised model of a larger dataset.}},

Abstract = {{This article articulates a digital adaptation of enumerative
   bibliography and argues for its recuperative potential in feminist
   literary history. Digital enumerative bibliography uses bibliographical
   structures within a relational database that allows researchers to track
   more relevant metadata such as geographical location of subject matter,
   language, and time period. Whereas traditional enumerative
   bibliographies use a hierarchy of textual data, a relational database
   creates a nexus that facilitates new kinds of research queries. As an
   example, we offer our digital project the Women in Book History
   Bibliography and use its 1,550 citations as a dataset to trace what is
   women's book history. We then advocate for digital enumerative
   bibliography as a form of feminist recovery efforts that recovers not
   only primary texts but scholarship about them.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This essay was written specifically for NYCDHWeek 2018, the theme of
   which was DH in the Moment: Reaction, Response, Relevance. The author
   examines how we define digital humanities activism and how we frame its
   histories. Relying primarily on examples from Caribbean-oriented digital
   work, the author argues for a broad definition of DH activism that
   allows for a variety of projects and intended audiences. In particular,
   the essay responds to the tendency to focus on ``DH in the moment{''}
   (projects that can be done quickly and yield a high social impact) as
   the primary form of activism, arguing that alongside such projects we
   include as activist projects that have a more cumulative and less
   immediate effect. Recently, we have begun to ask not just what the
   digital humanities does, but what the digital humanities does for
   others. This essay considers why it is that this has become a key
   question in this DH moment.}},

Title = {{A Model of Versions and Layers}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Our libraries are full of manuscripts, many of them modern. However, the
   digitisation of these unique documents is currently very expensive. How
   can we reduce the cost of encoding them in a way that will facilitate
   their study, annotation, searching, sharing, editing, comparison and
   reading over the Web? Unlike new documents prepared for the Web,
   historical manuscripts frequently contain internal variation in the form
   of erasures, insertions, substitutions and transpositions. Variation is
   also often expressed externally between copies of one work: in
   successive print editions, in manuscript copies or successive drafts.
   Current practice is to prepare separate transcriptions of each physical
   document and to embed internal variation directly into the transcribed
   text using complex markup codes. This makes the transcriptions expensive
   to produce and hard to edit, limits text reuse and requires that
   transcriptions be first disentangled via customised software for
   reading, searching, or comparison.
   An alternative approach, described here, is to separate out the internal
   variation of each document into notional layers. This is done primarily
   in order to facilitate the recording of revisions at any one point. The
   move is, of course, counter-intuitive since these document-wide layers
   were not intended by the author as texts to be read. But it proves
   itself in practice by radically simplifying the tasks of editing,
   searching and comparison. Versions, on the other hand, are higher-level
   constructs that do represent the state of a text as it was left at some
   point in time by an author or scribe.
   By employing layers to record complex revisions, the task of computing
   differences among intra-document layers and against versions of the same
   work in multiple documents may be delegated to the machine rather than
   having to be recorded laboriously by hand. The ensuing simplification of
   markup reduces transcription and editing costs, boosts text reuse and
   searching, and, by removing the need for customised software, increases
   the longevity of digital transcriptions.}},

Abstract = {{We present findings from interdisciplinary research at the intersection
   between literary studies, information visualization, and interface
   design. Despite a growing interest in text visualization among literary
   scholars, so far, narrative visualizations are not designed to support
   the particular tasks involved in narratological analysis and often fail
   to reveal nuanced narratological features. One major outcome of our
   iterative research and design process is Narrelations, a novel
   visualization technique specifically suited for analyzing and
   interpreting narrative levels of a story and temporal aspects of its
   narrative representation. The visualization provides an overview of the
   nesting and distribution of narrative levels, integrates the
   representation of temporal phenomena, and facilitates the examination of
   correlations between these aspects. With this research we explore how
   collaboratively designed visual encodings and interaction techniques may
   allow for an insightful analysis at a high level coupled with a close
   inspection of text passages. We discuss prior work relevant to our
   research objectives and explain the specific characteristics of
   narrative levels and temporal aspects of narrative representation. After
   describing the research process and design principles, we apply the
   visualization on a test corpus of eight annotated German short stories
   and demonstrate its heuristic value for literary analyses and
   interpretations. In particular, we explore the intricate connections
   between the literary content of the novellas and their narrative form.}},

Abstract = {{This article sheds an empirical light on interdisciplinary collaboration
   within the Digital Humanities by investigating the daily research
   practice of the Dutch Digital Humanities-project BRIDGE. The project
   developed and tested methods for automatically creating meaningful links
   and expanding archival television data. In the project, a high level of
   collaboration was required between scholars from two different
   disciplines: computer sciences and media studies. The majority of the
   epistemological encounters between the two disciplines took place in the
   design of the developed tools and the user studies to test the tools.
   The article is based on structured conversations between the two central
   staff members in the project, i.e. the computer science PhD-student and
   the media studies postdoctoral researcher. By unravelling the research
   project as a process of confrontation, identification and
   acknowledgement of situated knowledges, the article shows when and how
   the boundaries between the two disciplines have been maintained, crossed
   and blurred. The authors point to the benefits and challenges of
   interdisciplinary collaboration in the Digital Humanities, and formulate
   some best practices for future Digital Humanities-projects.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Using DIAS and DENDRON, computer applications designed for the study of
   infectious fungi and cancer cells, we forge a connection in color,
   composition, and theme between Paolo Veronese's Les Noces de Cana and
   Paul Cezanne's Baigneuse debout, s'essuyant les cheveux. From this
   connection, we bring to light a ``hidden{''} compositional structure,
   heretofore unidentified, in Cezanne's Bathers as a series. Using
   computer-assisted systems such as DIAS and DENDRON allowed us to detect
   relatedness in these paintings not necessarily visible to the human eye.
   With DIAS and DENDRON, we generated dendrograms that clustered paintings
   related in brightness, saturation, complexity, and color. After studying
   color, we applied DIAS to the study of Cezanne's composition. Because
   Cezanne expressed Neoplatonic ideals regarding paintings in his
   conversations and letters, we programmed DIAS to compute axial lines and
   ``golden sections{''} according to the dimensions of the square or
   rectangular painting under scrutiny. Using DIAS we identified the golden
   rectangle for Veronese's Les Noces de Cana, Cezanne's Baigneuse debout,
   s'essuyant les cheveux and Ingres' La Source (another likely model for
   Baigneuse debout, s'essuyant les cheveux). From the similarities and
   differences between the three paintings we identified, regarding their
   use of axial symmetry and the golden section, we have formulated a new
   approach to ``seeing{''} Cezanne's composition in his Bather series.
   Cezanne's noumenal bodies, formerly perceived as ``awkward{''} and
   composed with ``baffling imbalance,{''} we can now see as ``golden.{''}}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade tremendous advances have been made in the tools and
   platforms available for the digital study of manuscripts. Much work,
   however, remains to be done in order to address the wide range of
   pedagogical, cataloging, preservation, scholarly (individual and
   collaborative), and citizen science (crowdsourcing) workflows and use
   cases in a user-friendly manner. This study (1) summarizes the feedback
   of dozens of technologists, manuscript experts, and curators obtained
   through survey data and workshop focus groups; (2) provides a ``state of
   the field{''} report which assesses the current tools available and
   their limitations; and, (3) outlines principles to help guide future
   development. The authors in particular emphasize the importance of
   producing tool-independent data, fostering intellectual ``trading
   zones{''} between technologists, scholars, librarians, and curators,
   utilizing a code base with an active community of users, and
   re-conceptualizing tool-creation as a collaborative form of humanistic

Title = {{Distributed reading: Literary reading in diverse environments}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Reading has always been a contentious and political practice, but this
   is heightened in the contemporary moment both because of the way the
   environments in which we read are changing so radically. For Katherine
   Hayles reading is ``a powerful technology for reconfiguring activity
   patterns in the brain{''} {[}Hayles 2010, 193], a view representative of
   attempts to connect the new neuroscience of reading with age old
   practices of literary endeavour. For Sven Birkerts, however, ``the
   Internet and the novel are opposites{''} {[}Birkerts 2010], a view that
   suggests that a hierarchy of reading that locks digital readers out of
   higher order thinking and literary experience. Meanwhile, Anne Mangen
   finds that electronic reading environments ``negatively affect emotional
   aspects of reading{''} {[}Mangen 2016]. But these approaches tend to
   understand reading as something static that occurs in one space or
   another. However, in practice our reading is increasingly distributed.
   Reading can occur in multiple formats, across multiple platforms for the
   one text or reading experience. A novel begun in print can be read
   online in a born-digital format and concluded in a scanned digital
   format, for example. These journeys across platform require deeper
   investigation.
   If we think of the printed book as an interface between two orders of
   thinking, we need to consider how the experience of reading a digitized
   version of a formerly printed and bound book alters literary reception
   and student experience. How does the experience of reading across
   different technological platforms change the reader's relationship to
   the content? As more and more electronic reading platforms take on the
   physical attributes of material reading experiences either by retaining
   material traces or by emulating them, we might question what experience
   How do the material traces left on digitised works impact the reading
   process for reading in literary studies? The lively discourse
   surrounding Google Books and the human breaches of the material into the
   immaterial, as the work crosses the borders of formats and interfaces,
   raises valuable questions about the future of the book, reading in the
   twenty-first century, and the long and formidable shadow that centuries
   of material text production casts over Google Books' electronic utopia.
   This paper uses both book history and new media interface theory to
   consider the multitude of diverse experiences that is literary reading
   across different platforms in and out of the classroom and to consider
   whether distracted reading can be better understood as distributed
   reading. It considers critical infrastructure studies as a useful
   framework through which to think about reading in the digital age.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative studies in the syntax of Moliere are not very frequent. The
   present paper proposes a syntactic analysis of Moliere's characters that
   relies on the extraction of part of speech sequences and their filtering
   using correspondence analysis. In particular, the methodology is applied
   to the study of the evolution of the character of Sganarelle, appearing
   in several of Moliere's plays in prose and verse, and often reflecting
   the prototype of the ``bourgeois de Paris{''}, who isn't attuned to the
   new society of the young reign of Louis XIV, the ``mondains{''}. The
   analysis of the results is carried out with a register perspective, with
   the aim of identifying syntactic patterns that characterize the
   different Sganarelles with respect to the type of context in which they
   find themselves in the different plays. The results show how the
   evolution of the character can be traced from his first appearance to
   his later uses by Moliere.}},

Abstract = {{Digital humanities have a long tradition of using advanced computational
   techniques and machine learning to aid humanistic enquiry. In this
   paper, we concentrate on a specific subfield of machine learning called
   predictive analytics and its use in digital humanities. Predictive
   analytics has evolved from descriptive analytics, which creates
   summaries of data, while predictive analytics predicts relationships
   within the data that also help to explain new data. Predictive analytics
   uses machine learning techniques but also traditional statistical
   methods. It uses properties (or features) of the data to predict another
   target feature in the data. Machine learning is used by predictive
   analytics to establish the rules that given a certain combination of
   features make the target more or less likely. Predictive analytics can
   thus be considered to be a technique to machine-read data. The paper
   discusses the background of predictive analytics, its use for predicting
   the past and finally presents a case study in predicting past gender
   relations in a historical dataset. Predicting the past is introduced as
   a method to explore relationships in past data.}},

Abstract = {{Distraction is not a problem for scholarly reading in the humanities: it
   is, in fact, intrinsic to how we work. An openness to distraction
   facilitates knowledge creation in conversation with and between sources,
   bringing together disparate times and places, authors and forms of
   source material, frames of reference and layers of insight, harnessing
   peripheral vision as much as central focus to create the conditions for
   serendipitous discovery. This ``loose hold{''} on focus results in a
   knowledgescape with a substantial tacit dimension, with the result that
   humanists most certainly know more than we can tell. This is not to say
   that the epistemic process of the humanist is all encompassing, however:
   administrative work, for example, is viewed as a ``true{''} distraction,
   and managed accordingly.
   In spite of the wide availability of digital tools to consolidate and
   organise the process of extracting information from the reading of
   sources (be they text, image, landscape or indeed even the self), the
   notetaking process of the humanist remains stubbornly multimodal,
   harnessing embodied, material, and spatial dimensions of knowledge. The
   resulting knowledge environments humanists create around themselves
   resemble life-sized realisations in mixed media of a Prezi stack, a
   physical manifestation of the fragmented, capricious, haphazard stream
   of influences jostling for scholarly attention, and the scholar's
   understanding that their system inter-relationships are complex,
   sometimes tenuous, and largely undiscovered.
   This article will lay out the evidence for and implications of this
   understanding of humanistic reading, and then explore possible future
   paths for using technology to explore and indeed celebrate distraction,
   including: Technology as blurring the line between the personal and the
   professional, not so much as a labour practice, but as an epistemic one
   opening the way to the validation of ``epistemic emotions{''} as a valid
   research input, but also to the more effective convergence of humanities
   research with other inputs to the identity formation process of
   seemingly distracted undergraduates; and research infrastructural
   implications for libraries (where remote storage and electronic
   catalogues diminish the likelihood for serendipity, essentially by
   reducing distraction) but also for vitual research environments founded
   upon a new understanding of what the ideal humanistic work environment
   might be and how to get ``below the level{''} of that work.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the art history, the digital aesthetics, the
   technical anatomy, and the restoration of Shu Lea Cheang's early web
   artwork Brandon (1998-1999). Commissioned two decades ago by the Solomon
   R. Guggenheim Museum, the work is just back on view to the public after
   a major restoration. It seems timely to consider Cheang's artwork: a
   collaboration between the artist and a network of programmers,
   designers, authors and other contributors that offers a creative
   platform for remembering and engaging with histories and issues of
   identity from the LGBTQ+ community. In the spirit of the piece, this
   article is a multi-disciplinary collaboration between a curator, a media
   art conservator, a computer scientist, and a scholar of the digital
   liberal arts, which brings together these different areas of expertise
   to offer an innovative and multi-faceted consideration of one artwork
   from a digital humanities perspective.}},

Title = {{The Writeprints of Man: a Stylometric Study of Lafayette's Hand in
   Paine's `Rights of Man'}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Abstract = {{Thomas Paine's Rights of Man (Part I, 1791; Part II, 1792) is one of the
   most influential political tracts ever written. Recently, Clark (2015)
   has queried the long-established notion that Part I is the work of a
   single author, Paine himself. Clark argues that a passage of
   approximately 6000 words just prior to the ``Declaration of the Rights
   of Man and Citizens{''}, near midway through the book, was written by
   Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, and inserted by Paine into his
   book, perhaps with some editing. Clark's assertion rests mainly on
   judgement of the tone and content of the queried passage, as well as a
   hint in a letter by Lafayette to George Washington. This paper presents
   the results of a stylometric study of this question. Three computational
   approaches to stylistic analysis - one involving a consensus of six
   attribution techniques - were applied to the text of the Rights of Man,
   Part I, along with a corpus of comparison texts from the same period.
   Our findings tend to corroborate Clark's contention, as well as
   identifying two other short passages in which Lafayette may have had a
   hand, thus rendering this important document ripe for re-interpretation.}},

Title = {{``All Relate to Art{''}: The William Blake Archive and Its Web of
   Relations}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Abstract = {{The William Blake Archive emphasizes accuracy and objectivity. The
   photographed or scanned images are made faithful to their original
   objects in scale, color, and detail. The editors' notes are largely
   bibliographic and informative. The illustration descriptions consist of
   precise observations deliberately void of interpretation. The
   transcriptions are as diplomatic as the digital medium allows. And the
   explicit relationships between objects in the Archive are material; one
   can see, for example, copies of prints from the same relief-etched
   copper plate, or a design carried from a water color drawing to an
   engraved illustration. The scholar must be free to make his or her own
   interpretations.
   Since beginning to redesign the back end and front end of the site, the
   editors and staff have realized that more kinds of relationship might be
   made explicit. The challenge has been to decide which ones conform to
   our emphasis on accuracy and objectivity. In a neutral presentation of
   art and its contextual information, we can't tell the scholar that
   object X relates to object Y because they embody the same theme. That
   would impose on him or her our own interpretation. But we can say that X
   relates to Y because they contain some of the same text.
   In this paper we discuss the difficult task of digitally presenting more
   kinds of relationships in the Archive while staying objective. We
   explain how the task has compelled us to reevaluate Blake's methods and
   reencode the connections amongst his works accordingly. We describe
   planned enhancements to our tools used for representing and displaying
   these connections-enhancements that would benefit all archives, not just
   the Blake Archive. And finally we gesture towards further research into
   the philosophical context of Blake's practice of making related art and
   into the idea of relationship in archives in general.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decades, ``distant reading{''} became one of the most
   promising methodologies in the domain of computer-assisted literary
   analysis. This paper looks at an alternative path for gathering new
   insights about the literary texts, that of the ``shared reading{''}, or
   ``crowd reading{''}, consisting in multiple readings of the same text,
   performed by various readers and analysed so as to uncover new
   theoretical insights about the literary phenomenon, based on the
   observation of similarities and divergences amongst readers in text
   interpretation and text understanding. More precisely, this paper
   presents an experience of crowd reading applied to the modeling of
   literary characters, in view of a semi-automated analysis of these

Abstract = {{The question about cyberspace has generally been polarized around the
   concepts real / virtual and natural / artificial. The notion of space
   stands out among the empirical categories that have been handled such as
   real and natural. The spread of Internet has perpetuated this
   controversy. Thus, it is possible to distinguish a new opposition: on
   one hand, cyberspace understood as a deterritorialized, democratic and
   meaningless non-place; on the other hand, as a place subject to
   territorializing and identity movements that would come to put new
   borders, including the ``digital divide{''}, due to the dominance of
   globalization in the context of the network society. In this regard,
   thanks to the speed and possibility of almost universal interconnection,
   the dominant flows ``model{''} the space through the inclusion and
   exclusion of those nodes, more or less valuable for their interests.
   This paper will focus on analyzing the (cyber)space, and therefore it
   will criticize the dialectical simplifying the dialectics center and
   periphery or territorialization and deterritorialization.}},

Abstract = {{Collaboration has become a hallmark of Digital Humanities (DH) research.
   Nonetheless it remains under-discussed and for those not deeply engaged
   in DH a bit of a mystery. Drawing on recent DH work and publications
   that engage with questions of DH collaboration in different ways (e.g.
   {[}Deegan and McCarthy] {[}Griffin and Hayler 2016] {[}Hayler and
   Griffin 2016]), we analyse three types of DH collaboration: 1)
   human-human interactions; 2) human-machine/material interactions; and 3)
   machine/material-machine/material interactions. We argue that engagement
   with collaboration processes and practices enables us to think through
   how DH tools and practices reinforce, resist, shape, and encode material
   realities which both pre-exist, and are co-produced by them. We suggest
   that understanding these entanglements facilitates a critical DH in
   which academic hierarchies and disciplinary preconceptions are
   challenged.}},

Title = {{From Distracted to Distributed Attention: Expanded Learning through
   Social Media, Augmented Reality, Remixing, and Activist Geocaching}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{With the increasing proliferation of digital technologies into our daily
   routines, long-standing debates have resurfaced on the potential of
   prosthetic devices to extend our cognitive capacities and distribute
   intelligence across human and non-human agents. This article will
   propose ways in which we, as educators, can harness the distractions
   that new technologies can pose to teaching and research towards
   productive models of distributed attention and collective intelligence.
   By reflecting on the relationship between play and pedagogy through
   critical theory, as well as on the benefits of hyper-connected and
   collaborative learning, this article hopes to expand the branch of
   Digital Humanities that Holly Willis terms as the ``cinematic
   humanities.{''} Remixing, recontextualization, and the
   non-linear/non-sequential reconfiguration of information can provide us
   with new modes of distributed attention and critical making in the
   digital age.
   This article focuses on low and no-budget process-oriented collaborative
   projects for Cinema, Media Studies, and Digital Humanities courses
   (adjustable to other subject matters) that incorporate remixing, social
   and locative media, and augmented reality into experimental modes of
   connected and collaborative learning. The first assignment is a live
   film scoring remix, where students collectively brainstormed on picking
   sound clips/samples to add new soundtracks to early silent films.
   Remixing practices can offer new insights into cinema's legacy and
   challenge ocularcentric notions of film spectatorship by, in this case,
   reversing the conventional hierarchy of image-sound into sound-image and
   reflecting on how our minds attempt to process the impulse of sensory
   synchronization in cinema. The second sample assignment proposes new
   ways of using easy-to-learn and accessible GIS (Geographic Information
   System) and AR (Augmented Reality) tools to create projects related to
   civic engagement and local/online activism.
   The drifts from pre-determined learning outcomes are meant to be active
   disruptions to any prescribed limitations that delimit what digital
   humanities should or should not be, and other issues that often
   undermine the potential contributions to digital humanities that derive
   from the intellectual and material labor that happens in the networked,
   expanded and distributed classroom. The remix aesthetic, the
   ``unfinished{''} and makeshift nature of these projects is something
   that I find adds value to this kind of process-oriented pedagogy because
   it remains in touch with the pre-institutionalized experimental ethos
   that prompted the formation of the digital humanities and other
   disciplinary cross-pollinations.}},

Abstract = {{This study used three interdependent techniques to help understand the
   use and distribution of syllabic values of the cuneiform signs during
   the second half of the third millennium and early second millennium BCE.
   The results suggest that, during this period, cuneiform syllabaries were
   variable. That variation can further inform us about the regional,
   temporal, and dialectical contexts in which they existed. The addition
   of this research to the wider literature on the early adaptation of
   cuneiform enhances the field's understanding of how cuneiform syllabic
   values began to emerge and spread across the ancient Near East, and
   demonstrates how computational methods of analysis can be applied to
   research questions in humanities subjects.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of handheld digital devices has proved to be revolutionary
   for the teaching of art history. They make it possible to supplement,
   even replace, the traditional format of lecturing and communal viewing
   of a single screen. On their personal screens, students can enter a
   searchable world of thousands of virtual images: what the radical art
   theorist and novelist Andre Malraux, more than half a century ago,
   called ``the imaginary museum.{''} For several years, I have been
   experimenting with my art history classes, showing my students how to
   use their laptops, tablets and phones to become active viewers and
   collaborators.
   Multiple virtual images transform the content, as well as the
   environment, of learning art history. Rather than being restricted to
   the illustrations in a textbook, students can use their devices to
   engage with online image sources such as museum websites, image
   databanks, and auction houses. Portable digital technology can turn the
   art history classroom into a collaborative and dynamic experience
   inconceivable a short time ago. Malraux himself, who believed in the
   power of art to transcend time and space, might be amazed at what is now
   not only possible, but commonplace.}},

Title = {{Reverse Engineering the First Humanities Computing Center}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{The Jesuit scholar, Roberto Busa, is often called the founder of
   humanities computing. In fact, starting as early as 1949, he
   collaborated with IBM to perform experiments using suites of
   punched-card machines. These punched-card data systems-with their
   plug-board setups, clacking machinery, and flurries of perforated
   rectangular cards-were developed for business accounting and tabulating,
   and adapted for government censuses, defense calculations, archival
   management, and information processing of all kinds. The first decade of
   humanities computing can more accurately be described as an era of
   humanities data processing-in the historically specific and contextually
   rich sense of the term. This essay describes an ongoing collabroative
   project that aims to reverse engineer that center in the attempt to
   understand better this important site in the history of technology and
   humanities computing.}},

Title = {{From Distracted to Recursive Reading: Facilitating Knowledge Transfer
   through Annotation Software}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Rather than seeing hypertext as offering only distracted reading, this
   paper argues that annotation software provides students with the
   opportunity to perform recursive reading: a process that facilitates
   knowledge transfer and encourages intersectional critical approaches to
   texts. As hypertext editions and online reading communities have
   proliferated, scholars have theorized that these layered, interactive
   modes of reading produce distracted readings of texts, especially in
   pedagogical contexts. With annotation software, however, researchers and
   students have the opportunity not just to consume these distracted
   readings, but to produce them. Within the classroom, annotation software
   assignments require a deeper psychological investment from students than
   simply consuming a hypertext edition. By choosing how and where to
   annotate a particular text, students' distributed modes of attention are
   re-focused on the text itself, pulling disparate threads of thought
   together.}},

Title = {{Methodological Nearness and the Question of Computational Literature}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{The rise of the use of computational methods in both the study and
   production of literature poses questions about how to best read works of
   electronic literature which engage a wider sphere of human context
   beyond the literary text itself. Taking a cue from modes of ``distant
   reading{''} that have taken advantage of computational methods in order
   to pursue empirical and sociologically-influenced readings of
   traditional textual corpora, the liminal case of ``ambient
   literature{''} is examined. As a form of electronic literature developed
   out of the field of ubiquitous computing, ambient literature presents a
   literature which is intimately connected to the situation of the reader,
   offering a text whose meaning is both variable and specific to the
   conditions of its engagement. Having confronted analogous issues in
   other domains, traditions of research in human-computer interaction
   offer methodological insight into how such works might be read.
   Developing an account of how literary texts may be read from a distance
   through user studies, an ethnomethodological analysis of the experience
   of these hybrid works of electronic literature is advanced. By drawing
   connections between literary studies and human-computer interaction, new
   methods which focus on the analysis of the experience of multiple
   readers as they encounter works of electronic literature establish
   opportunities for future research into the contextual, embodied, and
   computational nature of literature today.}},

Abstract = {{The digitization of texts is omnipresent in the digital humanities. It
   seems to present itself only as a modification of the material medium:
   from text on paper to digital text. But it does more than that.
   Digitization also affects the text as a semiotic object. The multiple
   operations of this technology implement interpretative decisions that
   are not without their effects on the semiotic text; that is to say, the
   text that offers itself for reading and analysis. In this sense, the
   digitization of texts is not neutral. It is an important moment of
   material hermeneutics.}},

Title = {{Stealing a Corpus: Appropriating Aesop's Body in the Early Age of Print}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{The fate of the medieval Aesop during the early age of print reveals the
   tensions that arise between corporeal and proprietary understandings of
   artistic production. Building upon the highly accumulative, various, and
   expandable Aesopic tradition that thrived in the Middle Ages within
   scholastic manuscripts, the fifteenth-century fables of Robert Henryson
   and William Caxton confront movements to consolidate and transform
   Aesop's sprawling literary corpus into a singular printable property. At
   the same time that a single series of Aesop's fables, now known as the
   elegiac Romulus, became increasingly standardized within printed books,
   woodcut illustrations and textual descriptions increasingly beautified
   Aesop's body, transforming him from an inarticulate slave to an eloquent
   aristocrat. The simultaneous metamorphosis of Aesop's poetic and visual
   corpus reveals the premodern underpinnings for current efforts by
   publishing industries to immunize digital work from rogue acts of
   appropriation, mashup, and remix, practices which had previously defined
   Aesopic textuality. As a response to this textual vulnerability, the
   collapse of Aesopic work into a singular entity reimagines the
   allegorical relationship between the author or publisher and the work as
   proprietary, not corporeal. Rather than an extension of a generative,
   deeply somatic, and grotesque process of multiple fabular authors and
   commentators, the modernized Aesop obtains value as a ``property,{''}
   paving the way for the notion that creative corpuses can be ``owned,{''}
   effectively stealing away corporeal features from intellectual
   production.}},

Abstract = {{Given the growing popularity of laboratories as spaces for innovation,
   we present a framework of reference on the fundamentals that
   characterize them and explore their possibilities of incorporation into
   the academy, particularly in the field of digital humanities. We start
   from the hypothesis that the digital humanities in Spanish-speaking
   Latin America can recover some of the contributions of citizen
   laboratories to expand their reach through the incorporation of new
   actors and methodologies; establish a critical position against the
   dominant systems of knowledge production in the humanities on our
   current geopolitical scenarios; and design, make visible and recognize
   models and alternative loci of production, circulation and consumption
   of knowledge. Therefore, this article aims to characterize the culture
   of the laboratory and analyze the possibilities of its appropriation to
   promote processes of production of open knowledge in university
   environments, and in particular in the field of Ibero-American digital
   humanities.}},

   the literary discourse of the nineteenth century}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Abstract = {{In the nineteenth century, under the influence of positivism and
   emerging sciences, French literary critics sought to assert the autonomy
   of their discourse. In this work of legitimation, the use of textual
   citations supported the strategies of a critical judgment in search of
   objectivity and scientificity. Based on a large corpus of literary
   texts, this article attempts to automatically annotate the modal
   expressions used around reported speech. To this end, we will present
   two applications through which certain characteristic features of the
   literary critical discourse have been identified and analyzed: EXCOM-2,
   an annotation system of semantic and discursive categories; and
   E-Quotes, its web interface for searching citations.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the potentialities of networked browsing, a form of
   faceted searching that visualizes digital archives in the form of a
   force-directed network graph. Using BigDIVA.org as an example of
   networked browsing, this paper presents the results of a small usability
   study that compared how participants (N = 8) engaged with BigDIVA's
   networked browsing in comparison to use of a search engine such as
   Google. In doing so, we situate our study within performative
   conceptualizations of human-computer interfaces {[}Drucker 2013] in
   order to explore the potential becomings when human and nonhuman
   machinic component are entangled together. Based on the observations
   from our usability study, we argue that networked browsing is suggestive
   of Whitelaw's (2015) ``generous interfacing{''} that emphasizes browsing
   as a tool for exploring relationships between nodes in archives, as well
   as Shneiderman's (1996) ``joyous experience{''} for interfacing with the
   web.}},

Title = {{SpotiBot - Turing Testing Spotify}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Abstract = {{Even if digitized and born-digital audiovisual material today amounts to
   a steadily increasing body of data to work with and research, such media
   modalities are still relatively poorly represented in the field of DH.
   Streaming media is a case in point, and the purpose of this article is
   to provide some findings from an ongoing audio (and music) research
   project, that deals with experiments, interventions and the reverse
   engineering of Spotify's algorithms, aggregation procedures, and
   valuation strategies. One such research experiment, the SpotiBot
   intervention, was set up at Humlab, Umea University. Via multiple bots
   running in parallel our idea was to examine if it is possible to provoke
   - or even undermine - the Spotify business model (based on the so called
   ``30 second royalty rule{''}). Essentially, the experiment resembled a
   Turing test, where we asked ourselves what happens when - not if -
   streaming bots approximate human listener behavior in such a way that it
   becomes impossible to distinguish between a human and a machine.
   Implemented in the Python programming language, and using a web UI
   testing frameworks, our so called SpotiBot engine automated the Spotify
   web client by simulating user interaction within the web interface. The
   SpotiBot engine was instructed to play a single track repeatedly (both
   self-produced music and Abba's ``Dancing Queen{''}), during less and
   more than 30 seconds, and with a fixed repetition scheme running from
   100 to n times (simultaneously with different Spotify Free `bot
   accounts'). Our bots also logged all results. In short, our bots
   demonstrated the ability (at least sometimes) to continuously play
   tracks, indicating that the Spotify business model can be tampered with.
   Using a single virtual machine - hidden behind only one proxy IP - the
   results of the intervention hence stipulate that it is possible to
   automatically play tracks for thousands of repetitions that exceeds the
   royalty rule.}},

Abstract = {{The online project http://historyofaboriginalsydney.edu.au, now based at
   the University of Western Sydney, takes the educational and digital
   initiatives of today in a new direction. Dividing the city of Sydney
   into six geographic regions, we created a site based on the history of
   the Aborigines of Sydney since the invasion by the English colonisers.
   The site incorporates new forms of tagging, time line and digital maping
   to present multiple pathways of information in textual, video and
   photographic form. After seven years of investigation, we can offer our
   website balanced between unearthing lost knowledge and discovering new
   sources of information. We have incorporated all these into the site
   while exploring the potential for digital mapping and animation for
   purposes both of education and research. After carefully consulting
   professional Aboriginal educational groups, we believe that we have
   created a digital Indigenous history of Sydney, while at the same time
   returning to the Aborigines the history of which they have been deprived
   for so long.({[}10])}},

Abstract = {{In this essay, I examine the use of laptops in the classroom through the
   lens of boredom. Now that we can carry around an incredibly powerful
   little computer in our pockets or bring a lightweight laptop to class,
   boredom is a feeling that we almost never have to face anymore. We
   instantly alleviate the slightest hint of impatience or aimlessness with
   a single glance at our screens. But what introspective capacities do we
   neglect when we reflexively give ourselves over to the distractions of
   the outside world? What might dwelling within our boredom open up to
   students? Using my undergraduate Introduction to Digital Media course as
   a case study, I argue that a humanistic approach to digital media
   provides STEM students in particular with a means of contextualizing
   technical detail within larger sociopolitical systems, and that a focus
   on individual habits of attention can provide an important hinge between
   the granular and the global. Next, I reflect on the pressures produced
   by the very devices we studied on the classroom environment, and frame
   our experiences within some of the most influential writings on boredom
   as a historically and technologically conditioned mood. I then conclude
   with some speculations on planning for boredom within a laptop policy
   that is capable of accounting for a range of learning styles.}},

Title = {{Researcher as Bricoleur: Contextualizing humanists' digital workflows}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents findings from a set of contextual inquiry sessions
   completed in 2016 as part of the four year Digital Scholarly Workflow
   project (2012-2016) conducted at the Pennsylvania State University and
   funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Studying humanists' workflows
   through contextual inquiry enabled us to gain valuable empirical
   insights into digital scholarship from the perspective of individual
   scholars. This small-scale observational study (N=8) supplemented
   findings from our larger scale (N=196) and medium scale (N=23) studies
   previously completed in the project, allowing us to develop deeper
   qualitative understanding of how humanists' research practices change in
   the encounter with digital technologies. Through close contextual
   analysis of information-based research activities we illustrate how
   humanists build rich personal collections of digital sources, which
   become important information resources in their work. We also examine
   how adoption of digital tools transforms the established methods of
   managing primary and secondary sources, bringing hastier digital
   workflows to traditionally more methodical work. Finally, we show that
   efficiency cannot be qualified as a neutral or inherent characteristic
   of digital tools, independent of scholars' practices, since scholars'
   interaction with digital artifacts determines what constitutes
   efficiency of a tool in the context of a scholar's workflow. We conclude
   that in humanists' workflows digital and analog tools and resources do
   not necessarily replace one another or vie for the dominant position.
   They rather supplement each other in an interconnected, hybrid workflow
   that comes to our respondents as an organic manifestation of their work,
   and as an illustration of the bricolage character of humanists' digital
   workflows.}},

Abstract = {{For many years, digital humanists have responded to Alan Liu's call for
   critical digital humanities. Projects such as \#TornApart/Seperados and
   \#PuertoRicoMapathon and pieces like ``Where is Cultural Criticism in
   the Digital Humanities?{''} {[}Liu 2013], ``All the Digital Humanists
   Are White, All the Nerds Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave{''} {[}Bailey
   2011], and ``Beyond the Margins: Intersectionality and the Digital
   Humanities{''} {[}Risam 2015] have paved the way for socially conscious
   developments in the field. At the same time, pressures from
   administrators, institutions, and funding agencies often discourage
   critical engagement in favor of tool development and/or ``high tech{''}
   projects {[}Boyles 2018]. As such, we often attempt to adapt highly
   rewarded tech skills, like text, sentiment, and big data analyses, for
   use in social justice projects. While it is possible for these two aims
   to be compatible, we do ourselves a disservice when we try to force them
   together. So, how should teacher-scholars implement an intersectional
   digital humanities framework in the classroom? Using my own classroom as
   a case study, I assert that one effective strategy is through curation,
   which helps students investigate topics such as race, gender, sexuality,
   disability, and socioeconomic status through the careful selection,
   arrangement, and presentation of materials. Doing so teaches students to
   think more critically about the act of curation, by encouraging them to
   participate in knowledge construction as well as the dismantling of
   harmful narratives and power structures. While this approach differs
   from the tool-based pedagogy often utilized in the field, its emphasis
   on knowledge production, critical thinking, digital literacy, and social
   justice gives students proficiency in socially conscious methodologies
   that can be applied to any project. Linking curation to making and
   breaking, two digital humanities approaches to meaning-making, provides
   a method for interrogating ``archives of humanity{''} and developing a
   pedagogy grounded in cultural critique and social justice {[}Sadler and
   Bourg 2015].}},

Title = {{Reviving Classical Drama: virtual reality and experiential learning in a
   traditional classroom}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Over the past decades the advancement of technology and its subsequent
   introduction to the humanities has led to the development of several
   applications that enhance study and research in areas such as Classics,
   archaeology, epigraphy, and linguistics. The focus of digital humanists
   and other humanities scholars has turned to the efficient storage of
   information that facilitates search, comparative studies, accessibility,
   and consequently research. The common point of reference for the
   aforementioned applications is that they do not involve the need for the
   scholar to ``physically{''} be in a virtual space. In areas, such as
   archaeology and epigraphy, the creation of projects that provide access
   to 3D models of the artifacts as well as to virtual replications of
   ancient sites has resulted in the opening of new areas of research and
   reconsideration of traditional research issues. Also, {[}Forte et al.
   1997] argue that digital visualizations may make the ancient world more
   accessible to a larger audience. One may comprehend the structure of a
   vase and analyze its artistic patterns by zooming and relighting it. A
   problem that is yet to be considered, though, is how a scholar and a
   student are to perceive Classical drama, the theatrical space, the
   distances between the actors, the chorus, and the audience, the
   logistics of the performance, and the cultural aspects at play. This
   paper discusses the importance of experiential learning and the use of
   virtual reality as a means of promoting traditional edification methods,
   virtually recreating the actuality of the stage, and presents the Magic
   Mirror Theater, a web application designed to facilitate the study of
   Classical drama.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{The proliferation of tools that enable anyone to create visualizations
   of their data, even with limited experience or skills, has made data
   visualization more accessible than ever before. This is true in its use
   in both teaching and learning, as data visualization has increasingly
   taken on an important pedagogical role in the classroom and in scholarly
   research. However, with this proliferation of tools there has been a
   concomitant awareness that visualization needs to be employed through a
   critical lens that acknowledges its constructedness as explanatory
   medium and as a product of situated knowledges. Here, I describe one
   approach to teaching this notion of constructedness via a framework
   oriented around information literacy, which encourages critical
   engagement with data, the tools we use to interrogate them, and the
   visualizations we design to represent them. I describe this approach
   through a collection of ``critical dichotomies{''} used to evaluate the
   authority and value of visualizations, which are mapped to a subset of
   the core information literacy competencies defined in the ACRL Framework
   for Information Literacy in Higher Education. To put these dichotomies
   into practice, I further describe an interactive activity called
   ``Choose Your Own Adventure, with Data Visualization,{''} in which
   participants are given paper and markers to create booklets in the style
   of Choose Your Own Adventure books and asked to consider the
   relationship between active choices in the design process of a
   visualization and how a given visualization is interpreted. In the
   process, I explore how this framework can encourage us all, as critical
   practitioners of visualization, to think about the practical
   relationship between data visualization and information literacy more
   generally.}},

   in reconstructing and visualizing past landscapes. It discusses the

   briefly, to the broader context of archaeological theory, practice and

Title = {{Creative Data Literacy: A Constructionist Approach to Teaching
   Information Visualization}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Data visualization has rapidly become a standard approach to
   interrogating and understanding the world around us in domains that
   extend beyond the technical and scientific to arts, communications and
   services. In business settings the Data Scientist has become a
   recognized and valued role {[}Davenport and Patil 2012]. Journalism has
   re-oriented itself around data-driven storytelling as a potential
   saviour for an industry in peril {[}Howard 2014]. Governments are moving
   to more data-driven decision making, publishing open data portals and
   pondering visualization as an opportunity for citizen participation
   {[}Gurstein 2011]. This journal itself has numerous examples that use
   visualization tools and techniques within the digital humanities as a
   tool for exploration {[}Roberts-Smith et al. 2013] {[}Hoyt, Ponto, and
   Roy 2014] {[}Forlini, Hinrichs, and Moynihan 2016].
   This boom in attention has led large new populations of learners into
   the field. Formal educational settings have rushed to create new
   approaches and introductions to this content, but often they fall back
   on traditional approaches to things such as scientific charting and
   graphing {[}Webber et al. 2014] {[}Calzada and Marzal 2013]. Many view
   data visualization as a new technology, which runs the risks of
   replicating old approaches without acknowledging the unique affordances
   and domains that data visualization relies upon. Data visualization is
   not simply another technology to integrate into education. It is visual
   argument and persuasion, far more closely associated with rhetoric and
   writing than spreadsheets {[}Zer-Aviv 2014].
   In this paper we present novel approaches to learning technologies and
   activities, focused on novice learners entering the field of data driven
   storytelling. We begin with a deeper dive into the problems we see with
   introducing new learners into a field characterized by inequality,
   continue with a discussion of approaches for introducing technologies to
   education, and summarize the inspirational pedagogies we build on. We
   then offer some design principles and three activities as examples of
   the concept of creative data literacy. We assert that creative
   approaches grounded in constructionist educational theories are
   necessary to empower non-technical learners to be able to tell stories
   and argue for change with data.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},

Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{The use of new technologies, media and computational methods in
   Humanities may evolve and indeed it is already changing the
   ``contents{''} and ``forms{''} of contemporary education, opening new
   scenarios previously unimaginable. Nowadays Visual Mobile Devices,
   smartphones, tablets, etc, contribute to a range of computer-mediated
   activities, which are related to specific locations and times. But for
   such critical reflection, we need a closer look to deeper layers of our
   culture to unveil the characteristics of new technologies and devices.
   This paper describes some emerging aspects of the teaching use of visual
   communication techniques in primary and secondary schooling. In
   particular it reviews the evidence of the efficiency of visual
   communication for learning both in varied curriculum disciplines and of
   transversal socio-ethical affective skills necessary for the promotion
   of health and the construction of a planetary citizenship. The paper
   illuminates the didactic applicability and unique potential of images
   for the epistemological peculiarities of different disciplines,
   highlighting how educational use of images in creative pedagogy can be
   more focused given the function they perform in the more general
   cognitive process of individuals. The theoretical analysis of the
   teaching validity of the use of visual communication, as reported in the
   international literature, seems to receive confirmation from a case
   study, which provides detailed analyses of how this technique can
   enhance specific projects and demonstrates its significance for wider
   practitioners.}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues that digital humanities pedagogy can provide unique
   forms of attention and engagement for students at the outset of their
   college and university careers. It reports on courses taught at NC State
   University and elsewhere which use digital humanities pedagogy under the
   aegis of studying transformations in ``reading.{''} With attention to
   the mediation of attention itself, these courses can cultivate habits of
   self-reflection to aid students in any disciplinary pathway.
   Furthermore, digital humanities pedagogy can offer a transferable
   project-based model of instruction, helping students to develop
   metacognitive skills as well as to acculturate to different environments
   across campus. Ultimately, this essay underscores the need to articulate
   strategies of educational transfer in digital pedagogy.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Data visualizations are inherently rhetorical, and therefore bias-laden
   visual artifacts that contain both explicit and implicit arguments. The
   implicit arguments depicted in data visualizations are the net result of
   many seemingly minor decisions about data and design from inception of a
   research project through to final publication of the visualization. Data
   workflow, selected visualization formats, and individual design
   decisions made within those formats all frame and direct the possible
   range of interpretation, and the potential for harm of any data
   visualization. Considering this, it is imperative that we take an
   ethical approach to the creation and use of data visualizations.
   Therefore, we have suggested an ethical data visualization workflow with
   the dual aim of minimizing harm to the subjects of our study and the
   audiences viewing our visualization, while also maximizing the
   explanatory capacity and effectiveness of the visualization itself. To
   explain this ethical data visualization workflow, we examine two recent
   digital mapping projects, Racial Terror Lynchings and Map of White
   Supremacy Mob Violence.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},

Abstract = {{Technologies used to study and represent the past are not
   hermeneutically neutral. Since technologies have illocutionary force, we
   should ask of any representation of history, In what ways are the
   associated technologies conveying meaning? In this article, the question
   will be asked of a particular kind of history, textual history, taking
   biblical texts as an illustrative example. The goal is to better
   understand how textual technologies of yesterday, today, or tomorrow
   capture or obscure the material history of their texts. The article
   proceeds in two main parts. First, two kinds of technologies commonly
   used are examined and compared: the non -digital book and its familiar
   digital counterparts. Second, we will consider ways in which augmented
   reality and virtual reality have been used and might be used to
   represent texts. It will be suggested that these new technologies may
   overcome some of the limitation of previous book technologies in
   capturing a text's history. In conclusion, practical suggestions will be
   made for those who read, study, or produce digital textual objects.}},

   phonotext}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new listening methodology that lies, in some
   sense, between Charles Bernstein's close listening and Tanya Clement's
   distant listening. While it's tempting to think of these approaches as
   presenting an integral of scope, Bernstein's work proposes the use and
   tuning of the human ear for understanding the sonic materiality of the
   phonotext, while Clement's work, following its namesake of Moretti's
   distant reading, calls for a form of surrogate listening - using the
   machine in place of the ear. Building on Bernstein's work and toward
   Clement's, I suggest Machine Aided Close Listening as a methodology that
   uses data visualization as a prosthetic extension of the ear. This is to
   say that by considering three dimensions of the phonotext - 1) the
   textual manifestation of the poem, 2) the audio of the poet performing
   it, and 3) a visualization of that audio - the reader-listener can
   empirically confirm the ear's impressions and expose new facets of the
   sonic materiality of the performed poem. In support of this methodology,
   I will demonstrate a new digital tool for aligning these three facets of
   the phonotext.}},

Abstract = {{Typography, the arrangement and use of type, permeates our visual
   landscape, from printed pages and digital interfaces to physical
   environments and interactive experience. Those who study and work in the
   digital humanities are called upon to make typographic choices everyday,
   yet few have any training in how to effectively design with type. Over
   the past several years, I have been involved in several initiatives that
   seek to help educate digital humanities scholars, technologists and
   students about the value of information design, including typography.
   This paper will discuss these experiences and some guiding principles
   for helping a digital humanities audience understand the basic
   principles of typography and apply them to their projects and research.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{The history of human-environment interaction is embedded in stone.
   Stones are essential components of daily life and their various usage
   characterize certain areas or chronological periods. The form of a stone
   object is the result of a long chain of interactions with distinct
   bodies but the intangible life story of any artefact is partially
   registered in its original material properties and gradual physical
   alteration. Digital systems can be adopted for collecting these
   invisible records and tracing a stone's history. Chemical imaging and
   portable spectroscopy are quick and non-destructive remote sensing
   techniques that can be used to gather empirical data and track
   production and use of stone artefacts over time. This article reviews
   the application of Near Infrared Spectroscopy as a method for
   geochemical characterization of objects and as a tool for provenance
   studies within the Mobima project, carried out by an interdiscipli nary
   team of archaeologists and chemists at University of Umea, Sweden.
   Near Infrared Spectroscopy can be used for acquiring and processing
   spectral information directly in the field, modelling datasets of big
   assemblages and classifying objects.
   Making stones' biographies visible will help understanding the
   entanglement of past societies and their geological landscapes.}},

Title = {{Renaissance Remix. Isabella d'Este: Virtual Studiolo}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},

Abstract = {{Among the most elaborate and coherent instances of Renaissance
   self-fashioning and female self-determination through culture was a
   suite of rooms designed by Isabella d'Este in what is now the Ducal
   Palace museum of Mantua, Italy: a full-blown personal studiolo (study)
   and an adjoining smaller chamber she called the grotta (grotto).
   Isabella's studiolo is a regular point of reference in the study of
   Renaissance history and art, yet for centuries it has been accessible
   only in dispersed pieces and in spaces depopulated of major works and
   artefacts. Digital technology offers the possibility of creating a
   ``remastered{''} studiolo, a virtual space in which both visual and
   acoustic elements may be enhanced with respect to previous attempts at
   its representation. At the same time, historical uncertainty about
   numerous details in the arrangement of the objects in this collection
   requires a high level of flexibility in the digital remix, allowing for
   the programming of a customisable virtual environment. In anticipation
   of the project's full construction and in order to facilitate discussion
   with potential users about the Virtual Studiolo's backward design, the
   authors have developed a concept-demonstration video within the
   open-source Blender environment (www.blender.org). Among the concerns we
   aim to address in this phase of the project is how to combine historical
   accuracy, emotional power, and creative possibilities for users. This
   case study presents some of the opportunities, constraints and
   challenges we confronted during the production of our video as we strove
   within the Blender open environment for a result that will be
   historically accurate, emotionally compelling, and creatively flexible.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{The popularity of information visualization in academia and practice
   brings a renewed emphasis on aesthetic values and visual applications to
   ensure its appeal to a wider audience. This paper focuses on
   visualization aesthetics and perception by making the case for using
   graphic design techniques and design languages to understand and create
   more aesthetically pleasant and functionally effective information
   design and visualization. It uses cross-disciplinary reviews of
   background research to demonstrate the value of graphic design
   principles and methods in the realm of visualization education. A
   user-centered design framework and student projects are discussed by
   adapting graphic design elements into the visualization process. It
   shows that the practice of developing a visualization should be executed
   with an understanding of graphic design basics in mind, and with a
   balanced consideration of tangible and conditional design elements, as
   well as how these design elements fulfill the purpose of the objective,
   context, content, audience, and the knowledge of the design outcomes.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Digital reconstructions of classical antiquity are generally
   ocularcentric, appealing only to the sense of vision. We propose that
   new technologies may be used to engage the other senses in the act of
   reception, and specifically here we focus on kinaesthesia, or the sense
   of self-movement. This paper analyses a phase of the project Ancient
   Dance in Modern Dancers in which participants created performance pieces
   in a genre of Graeco-Roman dance for use in a motion-capture system. It
   was necessary for the performers to develop a range of translational
   strategies in order to communicate their movement to the system,
   entailing what we term ``distributed reception{''}, in which the
   ultimate recipient of ancient source-material is not a human actor but
   rather the machine with which s/he is in collaboration.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last few years, the Perseus Digital Library (PDL) and the Open
   Philology Project (OPP) have been moving towards enabling better
   interoperability and citability of their texts by implementing the
   Canonical Text Services URN standard and the Epidoc subset of the TEI P5
   guidelines. This is a resource-intensive effort necessitating a scalable
   workflow centered on continuous curation of these texts, from both
   within and outside the PDL/OPP ecosystem. Key requirements for such a
   workflow are ease of maintenance and speed of deployment of texts for
   use by a wide variety of analytical services and user interfaces.
   Drawing on software engineering best practices, we have designed an
   architecture meant for continuous integration with customizable services
   that test individual files upon each contribution made to our public git
   repositories. The services can be configured to test and report status
   on a variety of checkpoints from schema compliance to CTS-ready markup
   designed for flexibility and interoperability.}},

Abstract = {{The past twenty years have witnessed a mounting crisis in academic
   publishing. Companies such as Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, and Taylor
   and Francis have earned unprecedented profits by controlling more and
   more scholarly output while increasing subscription rates to academic
   journals. Thus publishers have consolidated their influence despite
   widespread hopes that digital platforms would disperse control over
   knowledge production. Open access initiatives dating back to the
   mid-1990s evidence a religious zeal for overcoming corporate interests
   in academic publishing, with key advocates branding their efforts as
   archivangelism. Little attention has been given to the legacy or
   implications of religious rhetoric in open access debates despite its
   increasing pitch in recent years. This essay shows how the Protestant
   imaginary reconciles-rather than opposes-open access initiatives with
   market economics by tracing the rhetoric of openness to free-market
   liberalism. Working against the tendency to accept the Reformation as an
   analogy for the relationship between knowledge production, publishers,
   and academics, we read Protestantism as a counterproductive element of
   the archivangelist inheritance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces MERCKX, a Multilingual Entity/Resource Combiner \&
   Knowledge eXtractor. A case study involving the semantic enrichment of a
   multilingual archive is presented with the aim of assessing the
   relevance of natural language processing techniques such as named-entity
   recognition and entity linking for cultural heritage material. In order
   to improve the indexing of historical collections, we map entities to
   the Linked Open Data cloud using a language-independent method. Our
   evaluation shows that MERCKX outperforms similar tools on the task of
   place disambiguation and linking, achieving over 80\% precision despite
   lower recall scores. These results are encouraging for small and
   medium-size cultural institutions since they demonstrate that semantic
   enrichment can be achieved with limited resources.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the use of a user-centred design approach for
   the development of generous interfaces/rich prospect browsers for an
   online cultural heritage collection, determining its primary user groups
   and designing different browsing tools to cater to their specific needs.
   We set out to solve a set of problems faced by many online cultural
   heritage collections. These problems are lack of accessibility, limited
   functionalities to explore the collection through browsing, and risk of
   less known content being overlooked. The object of our study is the
   Dutch Folktale Database, an online collection of tens of thousands of
   folktales from the Netherlands. Although this collection was designed as
   a research commodity for folktale experts, its primary user group
   consists of casual users from the general public. We present the new
   interfaces we developed to facilitate browsing and exploration of the
   collection by both folktale experts and casual users. We focus on the
   user-centred design approach we adopted to develop interfaces that would
   fit the users' needs and preferences.}},

Title = {{Crafting in Games}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the design space for crafting systems within games.
   A crafting system is the collection of game mechanics which enable a
   player to create virtual objects within a game, with examples ranging
   from making a pickaxe or placing blocks in Minecraft, to combining
   ingredients to create items in World of Warcraft, or designing a city in
   SimCity. Within both game design and game journalism there is no
   systematic understanding of what crafting means in games-rather, the
   term is used in an informal ``I'll know it when I see it{''} way, with
   different ideas of what constitutes ``crafting{''} becoming conventional
   for different game genres. We aim to create a more systematic analysis
   and language for virtual crafting, using a design space approach where
   we identify seven features of crafting systems; any given crafting
   system is understood in terms of the degree and manner in which it
   exemplifies these features. The features we identify are: recipe
   definition (how well-defined are the player steps for creating a virtual
   object), fidelity of action (how detailed is the player-performed
   enactment of crafting), completion constraints (how is creation
   constrained by virtual ``resources{''}), variable outcome (how much can
   the result vary when the player performs the same crafting actions),
   system recognition of outcome (to what degree do other game systems
   ``understand{''} and take account of what a player has made), player
   expressiveness (how big is the creative space provided to the player),
   and progression (how do the possibilities of crafting change over time).
   We apply these dimensions to the analysis of 64 crafting systems across
   47 example games. This more systematic analysis of the crafting system
   design space provides a deeper understanding of how games function as a
   creative and artistic medium for players, and provides a language and
   framework enabling scholars, critics and developers to more deeply
   understand existing crafting systems as well as unexplored opportunities
   for future crafting systems.}},

   and personal concerns, similar to other personal narratives such as
   diary entries. Differences between the two texts may reveal the
   linguistic markers of dream text, which could be the basis for new dream
   analysis work and for the automatic detection of dream descriptions. We
   used three text analytics methods: text classification, topic modeling,
   and text coherence analysis, and applied these methods to a balanced set
   of texts representing dreams, diary entries, and other personal stories.
   We observed that dream texts could be distinguished from other personal
   narratives nearly perfectly, mostly based on the presence of uncertainty
   markers and descriptions of scenes. Important markers for non-dream
   narratives are specific time expressions. Dream texts also exhibit a
   lower discourse coherence than other personal narratives.}},

Title = {{In a test bed with Kafka. Introducing a mixed-method approach to digital
   stylistics}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{In the emerging field of digital style analysis, scholars have been
   dwelling on a perceived irreconcilability of ``distant reading{''}
   {[}Moretti 2000] and ``close reading{''} {[}Fish 2012] {[}Ransom 1937].
   This situation is somewhat reminiscent of the ``paradigm wars{''} in
   social science, where for years, one could either adhere to a
   quantitative or a qualitative mindset. Taking seriously both the
   hermeneutic and the empirical traditions of (digital) stylistic
   research, the present paper proposes ``a mixed-methods{''} coalition of
   approaches. To establish links between the mixed-methods paradigm from
   Social Sciences {[}Creswell and Plano Clark 2007] and stylistic
   practices within Digital Humanities (DH), the present article discusses
   common methods of distant, close, and `scalable reading' as well as a
   flexibly adjustable definition of style {[}Herrmann et al. 2015]. In the
   practical part of the paper, I report a `mixed-methods digital
   stylistics' study on Franz Kafka's prose. Scaling the degree of
   abstraction and contextuality of the data according to particular
   research questions, I combine (1) ``quantitative hypothesis testing{''}
   (examining Kafka's stylistic ``uniqueness{''} by means of a stylometric
   measure); (2) ``quantitative exploration{''} (analyzing the first
   hundred statistically overrepresented words in Kafka); and (3)
   ``qualitative text analysis{''} (KWIC and close reading to investigate
   the functions of a particular style marker in the context of Kafka's The
   Judgment {[}Das Urteil]). Generally, for digital stylistics, I propose
   (a) raising epistemological and methodological awareness within the
   field, and (b) framing the research within the mixed-method paradigm
   that in fact seems very well suited to DH.}},

Title = {{Mining Embodied Emotions: A Comparative Analysis of Sentiment and
   Emotion in Dutch Texts, 1600-1800}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{This article presents a new model for emotion mining, resulting from the
   research project ``Embodied Emotions{''}. This project aims: 1. to trace
   historical changes in emotion expression and in the embodiment of
   emotions, and 2. to develop methods to trace these changes in sizeable
   corpuses of digitized texts. Up to now, the mining of sentiments or
   emotions has mainly been restricted to modern, or even very recent text
   corpora, such as social media. Sentiment mining techniques are often
   based on relatively simple emotion models of binary (positive/negative)
   oppositions, or limited sets of `basic' emotions and are not yet able to
   deal adequately with the complexity and the historical contingency of
   emotions and their expression. To meet these challenges, we have
   developed the Historic Embodied Emotion Model (HEEM), built on a test
   case of 29 Dutch language theatre plays written between 1600 and 1800
   and annotated manually with HEEM labels for emotions and body terms. In
   this article, we present this model and compare it with other sentiment
   mining techniques: 1) off the shelf linguistic analysis software LIWC
   (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), 2) a version of LIWC that has been
   adapted for the analysis of Dutch historical texts, 3) a new Dutch
   translation of WordNetAffect. We conclude that, although different forms
   of sentiment mining have their value and use, HEEM provides new
   opportunities for emotion mining and analysis of embodied emotions in
   historical texts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses a digital humanities collection called
   ``Contemporary Telepathics{''} housed within a larger archive, The
   Fabric of Digital Life. We argue that through a variety of multimedia
   representations, the rhetoric of contemporary telepathic devices invokes
   sublime predictive visions that become instantiated in popular media,
   news organizations, and disclosures of technology advancement. We
   discuss the theoretical grounds for a collection of technological
   forecasts, at a time when they are largely considered ephemera. We also
   discuss how tracking the telepathic sublime as a dynamically evolving
   popular communication phenomenon requires a unique, humanities-based
   metadata scheme and archival practice.}},

Title = {{Scaffolding and Play Approaches to Digital Humanities Pedagogy:
   Assessment and Iteration in Topically-Driven Courses}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Discussions of digital humanities pedagogy have often focused on
   discussions of ``scaffolding{''} and ``play{''} (alternatively,
   ``tinkering{''}) approaches, and methods for assessing student work
   appropriate to both techniques. While these approaches may seem
   oppositional, we emphasize the need to balance them in most classroom
   contexts, and explore challenges with integrating new digital humanities
   platforms in topically-driven humanities classrooms. We examine our
   experiences as an instructor and a librarian partnering to include a
   multimedia publishing assignment sequence in a course on the history of
   children's literature, and our assessment of our approach to instruction
   in a distance graduate education context that is not amenable to the
   ``lab{''}-based learning usually used in person for DH learning. While
   discussions of assessment of DH classroom projects generally focus on
   the question of how to grade student work, we argue that assessment is
   as important for reflecting on and evaluating pedagogy, including how to
   balance and iteratively improve ``scaffolding{''} and ``play{''}
   approaches. These issues are important not just for experienced DH
   instructors, but also humanities instructors without a DH background
   beginning to integrate digital assignments as a new norm.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{This article analyses advertisements to shed light on the ways in which
   the Coca-Cola Company tried to shape the Dutch perception of an American
   way of life, and by extension provided the discursive building blocks
   for the construction of a mental map of America. Since the National
   Library of the Netherlands (KB) digitized its newspaper collection, we
   could analyze newspapers using both computational and traditional means.
   The central question this article addresses is: Did Coca-Cola
   advertisements in Dutch newspapers communicate themes that represented
   the American way of life? Using two separate workflows, we demonstrate
   how we combined computational and traditional methods in an iterative
   and transparent manner. These workflows are systematic descriptions of
   how we used computational tools to answer this paper's central research
   question.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Humanities (DH) is a field of research in which humanists at the
   National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) can take part and about
   which they can collaborate in debates and projects. Introducing DH in
   the academic programs at an undergraduate level can be a difficult path
   to traverse. Even so, for the academic year 2016, we managed to include
   a Specialized Seminar-Workshop on this field of study within the History
   Course at the Facultad de Filosofia y Letras at the UNAM. This article
   shows and analyzes the context, the methods and the academic, technical
   and specialization implications DH has in the History field (and in
   Humanities in general), and also presents the results of our teaching
   work, of the research project in teaching to which it is connected, and
   of some other activities which aim at establishing an academic digital
   culture in this School's community.}},

Abstract = {{The paper proposes to bridge two areas of inquiry, digital hermeneutics
   and metaphor within a digital environment, by the analysis of a less
   studied phenomenon, i.e. how interpretation is supported and shaped by
   metaphors embedded in an interface. The study is articulated around
   three use cases for literary, didactic and historical representations of
   imaginary and existing cities based on a model (z-text) and interface
   (Z-editor) for zoomable texts. We will try to demonstrate that the
   zooming and contextualization features of the tool allow creating layers

Title = {{Digital Oulipo: Programming Potential Literature}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{The formally constrained work of the Oulipo (l'Ouvroir de Litterature
   Potentielle, loosely translated as Workshop of Potential Literature)
   lends itself particularly well to digital studies, which was quickly
   recognized by the members of the group. To facilitate its goal of
   avoiding chance in its literary production, the group was naturally
   drawn to the determinism of computers, where true chance is simply
   impossible. In its early years, therefore, the group used algorithmic
   procedures as a starting point for various texts and also attempted to
   program these texts on actual computers, creating some of the first
   electronic literature and embarking on proto-digital humanities work as
   early as the 1960s and 1970s, later abandoning these efforts and
   relegating all subsequent activity to a subsidiary group.
   To understand the Oulipo's forays into computer science and more
   importantly, why they abandoned them, I designed and carried out one of
   the inaugural projects of the Princeton Center for Digital Humanities.
   The goal was twofold: first, through exploratory programming, I intended
   to create interactive, digital annexes to accompany my doctoral
   dissertation; more importantly, I hoped that by attempting to reproduce
   the Oulipo's own algorithmic efforts, I would gain similar insights into
   the nature of ``Potential Literature{''} and be able to understand why
   the group abandoned such efforts after the 1970s.
   This article describes the content, development, and results of my
   project. For each of my three Python-based annexes, I offer a historical
   survey of the Oulipian text or procedure discussed within and the
   Oulipo's own proto-digital humanities experiments; then, I will talk
   about my own experiences as a coder-researcher, what learning Python has
   brought to my project, and how my exploratory programming offered me a
   new kind of critical reflection. Establishing these annexes forced me to
   learn to code, a type of work that does not only produce digital texts,
   but also helped me to reflect on the notion of chance in a more nuanced
   way. Finally, coding has allowed me to better understand the Oulipian
   mentality concerning this sort of digital experimentation.}},

Title = {{The New Itinerancy: Digital Pedagogy and the Adjunct Instructor in the
   Modern Academy}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{In the Fall of 2015, I was hired as contract academic staff at Wilfrid
   Laurier University's Department of English and Film Studies to teach the
   foundation course EN245 ``The English Literary Tradition (Beginnings to
   1660){''} for the first time as a course with a heavy DH component. My
   paper is a case study investigating the challenges of creating and
   delivering a partially online course in a university environment where
   the majority of teaching is done by sessional instructors whose labour
   is systemically marginalized by administration. Sessional instructors
   (or ``educational entrepreneurs{''}) have even more limited resources
   (in terms of time, access to technical support, and access to
   administration) than tenure track faculty; however, open-access
   educational tools aren't serving merely to level the playing field, but
   reshape it altogether as technical support and access to administrative
   support cease to matter in the delivery of an educational product.
   Today, many of the tools that are sufficient for the creation of a
   successful online or partially online course, whether generalist -
   iTunesU, Zotero, YouTube - or specialist - Google NGram, the University
   of Victoria's Map of Early Modern London, Internet Shakespeare Editions
   - are freely available to instructors.
   Such freely available tools problematize the relationship between the
   instructor and the university insofar as universities tend to use
   proprietary systems (e.g. Desire2Learn) for everything, including data
   management, presentation, communication, and gradebook integration with
   the registrar's office. Universities, in insisting on using these
   universal proprietary systems for every aspect of course delivery,
   exacerbate the disenfranchisement of sessional instructors, as access to
   the support required to become experts in these tools is limited and
   taken on at the instructor's cost. A sessional instructor can create an
   entire course using freely available online tools, at minimal cost and
   reaching a tremendously large and diverse audience, yet cannot then
   market that course to any university that has a similar course as an
   educational product. At the present moment, the sessional instructor and
   the course are both subject to the curriculum of an individual
   university and department, despite the fact that courses with a heavy DH
   component tend towards portability, interoperability, and modularity
   that renders such boundaries largely incoherent. Though there are
   attempts to provide funding for courses that will bridge interuniversity
   boundaries such as the \$4.5 million put forward by the Ontario Ministry
   of Training, Colleges and Universities as a part of the eCampus Ontario
   initiative, such funding models largely exclude the sessional
   instructor, who cannot apply for funding as an ``educational
   entrepreneur.{''} My paper will tell the story of how I tried to
   navigate a university system that tried to keep me from using free
   tools, while at the same time promoting my course as a part of the
   eCampus Ontario initiative.}},

   Humanities Computing Project}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This paper traces the little-known history of the London Stage
   Information Bank, a digital initiative that ran from 1970 to 1978 under
   the direction of Professor Ben R. Schneider, Jr. at Lawrence University.
   With support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the
   American Council of Learned Societies, and the Mellon Foundation,
   Schneider's team produced a database from the multi-volume reference
   work The London Stage 1660-1800 (Southern Illinois University Press,
   1960-68). Today, however, most of the project's outputs are lost or
   damaged, and its history has been largely forgotten in both theater
   studies and eighteenth-century studies. This essay traces the history of
   the Information Bank and my efforts to recover its damaged data and
   code, offering the project as an object lesson in questions of access,
   preservation, and institutional memory that digital humanities
   practitioners continue to confront in 2017. I argue that the project
   faded into obscurity, not only because of technological obsolescence,
   but also because the development team was unable to promote the kinds of
   research questions and behaviors that would enable their tool's
   widespread adoption and survival. The indifference of literary and
   theater scholars to the Information Bank throughout the late 1970s and
   early 1980s demonstrates how vital it is that digital and computational
   humanities work articulate its meaningfulness within existing
   intellectual and disciplinary traditions. While digital scholars build
   new avenues for inquiry that expand and transform humanities research,
   the survival of these approaches depends on their relationship to
   current humanities questions, methods, commitments, and epistemologies.}},

Abstract = {{Interdisciplinary collaboration brings the benefit of multiple
   perspectives to a research project, yet it also provides opportunities
   for reflection on each discipline's knowledge base. This article
   presents a case study in interdisciplinary collaboration between two
   disparate fields, web development and anthropology. We explore the
   challenges of translating between domains with differing values, aims
   and methodologies, as well as issues that arose for us during the
   development of a web application designed to provide a digital output of
   an ethnographic project. We consider our experience using the Agile
   style of software development, which emphasises rapid prototyping,
   iteration and even failure. In the long run, we find negative
   experiences in web development can be more valuable than the positive
   ones. The concept of `knowledge brokerage' is a useful term to describe
   the collaboration between the academics - who were forced to
   conceptualise their data in new ways - and the developer - who
   negotiated these transitions between abstract information and binary
   data, and between academia and a public-facing web application.}},

Title = {{Building a Toolkit for Digital Pedagogy}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Despite the perceived newness of electronic methods in physical
   classrooms, electricity-and the distributed labor on which it runs-has
   long powered the spaces of pedagogy. Routing electronic practices in
   undergraduate teaching through the digital infrastructures with which
   they operate, this writing tests circuits of power that migrate between
   disciplinary and physical learning systems. It does so through a
   discussion of Pedagogy Toolkit, an open source and community-authored
   teaching repository built with Jekyll and deployed via GitHub Pages.
   Contributing to an increase of energy for project-based interventions in
   digital humanities teaching, Pedagogy Toolkit circulates digitized
   teaching materials, guides to teaching with digital humanities tools, a
   curated sample of online syllabuses accompanied by a syllabus templating
   tool, and an accessible website templating framework. An overview of new
   methods for digital teaching in the undergraduate classroom leads in
   turn to a reflexive discussion of the design of digital platforms as
   pedagogical objects, activating issues of labor, diversity, and
   knowledge transmission along the way. Ultimately, building a toolkit for
   digital pedagogy constructs infrastructure as a mode of intellectual
   inquiry, exposing classroom power as a conduit for ethical connections
   between students, teachers, and digital development teams. Rerouting
   logics that partition teaching practice and tool development, this
   article situates building communities at the heart of humanities
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{This case study outlines how writing for Wikipedia can benefit students
   in an undergraduate literature class by having them undertake scholarly
   research, read unmediated texts, and write for a real-life audience. In
   keeping with the collaborative spirit of Wikipedia, the rubrics provided
   here were primarily created by the class as a whole. Estill demonstrates
   how this assignment encouraged students to question received notions of
   literary canon and to engage critically with Wikipedia itself. Perhaps
   paradoxically, writing for Wikipedia gave students ownership of their
   writing and research. Ultimately, this assignment facilitated students
   to become experts on understudied topics and helped them learn about how
   to do literary research.}},

Title = {{Playing with Identities: Queering Digital Narratology and the
   Exploration of Gender and Sexual Identities}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This study builds upon previous research that discusses gender and
   sexual identities and digital narratives by introducing a queer
   narratological approach to character creation mechanics. First, Lisa
   Nakamura's identity tourism and narratological constructs are applied to
   formalize the concept of the exploration in digital narratives. Second,
   exploration of gender and sexual identities is demonstrated through a
   queer narratological analysis of two digital narratives, Always
   Sometimes Monsters (2014) and Hustle Cat (2016). Third, the development
   of character creation mechanics in The Sims (2000-2016) series is
   examined to reflect the advancement toward progressive game designs.
   Concerns regarding a sexuality blind approach and the downplaying of
   homophobia are addressed, and Helene Cixous's poststructuralist ``other
   bisexuality{''} as a transgressive product of the fluidity of identities
   in digital narratives is emphasized. This study elaborates the
   often-disregarded workings of queer narratology and theory in digital
   narratives or game designs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a digital teaching application that approaches the
   study of language and literary works from a social semiotic perspective
   and represents an innovative pedagogical model for world language and
   literature classes. The Golden Age Literature Glossary Online, known by
   the acronym GALGO, consists of an online glossary of select keywords,
   from canonical texts of Golden Age Spanish literature, whose multiple
   connotations illuminate important linguistic and social concepts of the
   16th and 17th centuries. GALGO incorporates British cultural historian
   Raymond Williams' methodology in his Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture
   and Society: namely, identifying problem-laden words or ``keywords,{''}
   charting their distinct usages across texts, and reflecting critically
   on clusters of associated words. GALGO seeks to instantiate language as
   social semiotic by linking the semantic configurations of a literary
   work simultaneously to the cultural environment, the linguistic system,
   and the social system. Applying the conceptual design of M.A.K.
   Halliday's social semiotic model, GALGO's interpretive apparatus
   provides the field of discourse or context of situation for the text in
   which a specific keyword appears. The field of discourse presents
   clusters, word groupings of semiotic affinity that describe the social
   action that is taking place in the text.
   GALGO also performs an interpretation of the tenor of discourse,
   highlighting sociological variables connected to class status, gender
   role and racial category that refine a keyword's meaning from the
   perspective of interpersonal relationships. Finally, GALGO adds
   commentary on discursive structures, such as patterns of grammar,
   syntactic nuances, and figurative language, that surround the keyword in
   the text. GALGO's strength resides in the synchronic connectivity that
   the system facilitates when identifying the constellation of meanings
   for any given keyword. From a technical perspective, the system has the
   ability to efficiently identify the absolute position of all uses of a
   keyword across multiple texts, so that large texts can be managed and
   search times minimized for both users and system administrators. GALGO
   is constructed in such a way that users can not only access existing
   analysis within the database, but also can assume, when instructed to do
   so, the role of the system administrator and contribute their own
   annotations. A team of faculty and student administrators are currently
   building the database with research previously collected in Spanish
   Golden Age literature seminars. Providence College students have
   utilized the social semiotic methodology underlying GALGO for several
   years now with successful outcomes both in terms of their growth as
   language majors and critical thinkers.}},

Abstract = {{While the massive and difficult task of finding, documenting, and
   centralizing collections is certainly of great concern to image
   archivists, and has been the motivating factor for beginning numerous
   digital humanities projects, strategies and best practices for archiving
   challenging or offensive visual objects (images that are non-canonical,
   violent, and ambiguous) remains under-theorized. Using the Pitt Rivers
   Museum, the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia, Harpweek, the Center
   for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, and Visual Haggard: The Illustration
   Archive as case studies, I address the question of how digital image
   archivists ought to approach the task of curating objects with the
   potential to cause trauma. I bring together several critical
   strands-most importantly visual culture, race theory, and archival
   science-to question how the structure of a digital archive database
   might best achieve the goals of educating the public, supporting social
   justice, and enabling the researches of humanities scholars.}},

Title = {{The MoEML Pedagogical Partnership Program}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Since 2014, The Map of Early Modern London (MoEML) has partnered with
   professors and students around the world in a unique collaboration
   between a digital humanities (DH) project and humanities classrooms. The
   model we have developed addresses a sustainability challenge for DH
   projects, provides professors with a way of meeting administrative
   demands for engaged learning, and gives students a high-stakes
   research-based learning opportunity with the potential for an
   open-access, peer-reviewed publication. The MoEML Pedagogical
   Partnership Project emerged from a confluence of problems and
   opportunities. One longstanding problem for DH practitioners is
   project-based: how do we sustain the projects already begun? Another
   problem emerges as DH moves out of the ``big tent{''} and sets up camp
   in humanities classrooms at smaller, non-R1 institutions. Also, for
   scholars not trained in the technologies that drive many DH projects,
   crossing the analog-digital divide might be daunting and discourage them
   from contributing to DH projects. To address these challenges, the MoEML
   Pedagogical Partnership takes Research-Based Learning (RBL) models and
   turns them into high-profile publication opportunities, mobilizing
   ubiquitous social networking and communication technologies to connect
   the project with the new demographic of student contributors. This essay
   will highlight how digital projects and digi-curious professors can
   collaborate to develop innovative pedagogical practices that provide
   projects with content, enliven professors' pedagogy, and invite students
   to acquire scholarly research skills, gain digital literacy, and engage
   in an interdisciplinary and international collaboration. We argue that
   DH projects can be used innovatively and effectively in the classroom to
   promote RBL. At the same time, DH projects-open-access ones in
   particular-can provide a home both for humanities research and for the
   fruits of digital pedagogy across a wide range of institutional
   settings.}},

Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Interest in the role of book cover images in readers' reading experience
   and book marketing has been long-standing. This study attempts to
   compare book covers from different countries with a media visualization
   tool called ImagePlot. The top 100 bestselling books from 13
   Amazon.com's international sites were identified and their cover images
   were downloaded. Using ImagePlot, median values of brightness, hue and
   saturation for each image in the data set were extracted and analyzed.
   Along with one-way ANOVA tests and the resulting graphs from SPSS,
   ImagePlot outputs show differences in these graphical properties of
   bestsellers' cover images in different countries. From the outputs, with
   all the book cover images displayed on a single canvas (screen), hidden
   patterns emerged and findings were clearly confirmed. This study makes a
   contribution by providing connection between research interests in book
   cover images and media visualization techniques for further research.}},

   assignment in a traditional undergraduate literature classroom at
   Fairfield University while in a pedagogical partnership with The Map of
   Early Modern London, an award-winning, peer-reviewed digital humanities

   crowdsourcing opportunities can offer a way for faculty at small liberal
   arts colleges and universities to increase digital literacy among their

   undergraduate coursework. I then offer a series of preparatory steps and

Title = {{Old Content and Modern Tools - Searching Named Entities in a Finnish
   OCRed Historical Newspaper Collection 1771-1910}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Named Entity Recognition (NER), search, classification and tagging of
   names and name-like informational elements in texts, has become a
   standard information extraction procedure for textual data. NER has been
   applied to many types of texts and different types of entities:
   newspapers, fiction, historical records, persons, locations, chemical
   compounds, protein families, animals etc. In general, the performance of
   a NER system is genre-and domain-dependent and also used entity
   categories vary {[}Nadeau and Sekine 2007]. The most general set of
   named entities is usually some version of a tripartite categorization of
   locations, persons, and organizations. In this paper we report trials
   and evaluation of NER with data from a digitized Finnish historical
   newspaper collection (Digi). Experiments, results, and discussion of
   this research serve development of the web collection of historical
   Finnish newspapers.
   Digi collection contains 1,960,921 pages of newspaper material from
   1771-1910 in both Finnish and Swedish. We use only material of Finnish
   documents in our evaluation. The OCRed newspaper collection has lots of
   OCR errors; its estimated word level correctness is about 70-75 \%
   {[}Kettunen and Paakkonen 2016]. Our principal NE tagger is a rule-based
   tagger of Finnish, FiNER, provided by the FIN-CLARIN consortium. We also
   show results of limited category semantic tagging with tools of the
   Semantic Computing Research Group (SeCo) of the Aalto University. Three
   other tools are also evaluated briefly.
   This paper reports the first large scale results of NER in a historical
   Finnish OCRed newspaper collection. Results of this research supplement
   NER results of other languages with similar noisy data. As the results
   are also achieved with a small and morphologically rich language, they
   illuminate the relatively well-researched area of Named Entity
   Recognition from a new perspective.}},

Title = {{An Ontology for Gendered Content Representation of Cultural Heritage
   Artefacts}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{The need for organising and digitally processing the vast amount of
   Cultural Heritage (CH) information has recently led to the development
   of formal knowledge representation models (ontologies) for the CH
   domain. Existing models, however, do not capture gender-related
   concepts. This article presents an effort to fill this gap by developing
   a new ontology for the representation of gendered concepts in CH
   resources. The new ontology, named ``GenderedCHContents{''} resulted
   from combined research in women's studies, gender theory, and computer
   science. Its primary aim is to draw attention to the presence of women
   within CH artefacts. The proposed ontology extends the Europeana Data
   Model (EDM) with twenty-two new classes, sixteen object properties and
   seven datatype properties. The article presents a demonstration of the
   ``GenderedCHContents{''} ontology's use in five different representation
   tasks, which describe five resources related to Pandora's myth. Lastly,
   the study stresses the benefits of reasoning support (i.e. enabling
   computers to infer further information from a set of asserted facts) in
   revealing different gender ideals and inferred relationships between
   metaphorical concepts, along with the benefits of the Semantic Web in
   making information about gendered contents more easily retrievable to
   the users.}},

Abstract = {{Digital humanities projects and methods are becoming increasingly common
   in undergraduate humanities classrooms. Digital projects and exercises
   allow students to engage with new technology, collaborate with peers,
   graduate students, and faculty, and produce tangible scholarship that is
   publicly visible. The Lab for the Education and Advancement in Digital
   Research (LEADR), a new student-focused digital humanities initiative at
   Michigan State University, has introduced digital components into large
   numbers of of History and Anthropology courses. Through two years of
   courses, it has proven fruitful to frame these not as ``Digital
   Humanities projects,{''} but as part of a digital liberal arts
   curriculum that seeks to teach students not only about the
   domain-specific content, but also essential skills for information
   retrieval and analysis, media literacy, and communication in the digital
   age. This framework places these skills as extensions of longstanding
   skills, literacies, and knowledges that humanities and social sciences
   have contributed towards liberal arts education.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},

Abstract = {{There has been much discussion about digital humanities (DH) both as a
   discipline and as a community of practice.{[}1] Whatever the balance of
   opinion, the emergence of digital scholarship in the humanities has
   undoubtedly had considerable impact on many disciplines; one such
   discipline is Classics and the study of the ancient world more
   generally. This article uses the Digital Classicist (DC) as an example
   of a DH community in a case study which traces its development and
   growth to examine what might be learned. As a community the DC joins
   together practitioners interested in the application of innovative
   digital methods and technology to the study of the ancient world (in its
   widest sense). How has this come about and perhaps more importantly, how
   has it been sustained and indeed provided the inspiration for other
   affiliated communities? What do we understand by a community and the
   association of individual practitioners separated by distance? It is
   important that members feel that they are stakeholders, that they have a
   sense of ownership and derive value from participation and contribution.
   It is argued here that a community could be seen as a symbolic and
   intellectual construct, one of perception rather than physicality to
   facilitate the exchange of ideas and so effect growth and strengthen the
   discipline.}},

Abstract = {{Collaboration is an ethically charged relationship that challenges
   traditional modes of authorship attribution, institutional norms, and
   expectations of teaching and learning. A careful reflection on the needs
   and expectations of project participants demands an exposure of the
   seams and social dynamics inherent in research-driven relationships. In
   this paper, we ask: How does integrating digital scholarship into
   undergraduate pedagogy challenge systems of evaluation and credit and
   affect collaboration in research environments tuned to promotion and
   tenure? Emerging from our participation in the Scholarly Communication
   Institute (2015) in the Research Triangle of North Carolina, this
   article presents the findings of a team tasked with evaluating best
   practices and better understanding how authorship and contributorship
   models emerge in heterogeneous teams of students, faculty, staff,
   \#alt-ac roles, librarians, programmers, and community partners.({[}1])}},

   latent assumptions of DH belonging and community. By adhering to these
   design principles we have been able to question some of the assumptions

   scholarship, demonstrating these theories' complex relationships public,
   semi-public, or private dissemination; classroom and non-classroom

Title = {{Teaching Electronic Literature as Digital Humanities: A Proposal}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This essay presents an approach to teaching Digital Humanities through
   two largely unexplored lenses: electronic literature and foreign
   languages (Spanish in particular). It offers a practical example of a
   course taught during the Spring of 2016 at UC Berkeley that combines
   literary analysis with the teaching of basic programming skills, and DH
   tools and methods. Concretely, this course is an upper division,
   undergraduate writing intensive class, where students learn how to write
   and talk about electronic literature-e.g. hypertext novels, kinetic
   poetry, automatic generators, social media fictions, etc.-, learning
   specific terminology and theoretical frameworks, as they gain the skills
   to build their own digital art pieces in a collaborative workshop
   setting. By taking this course as a practical example, this essay
   tackles three important pillars in the humanities. Firstly, the overall
   concept of literature, and more specifically, the literary; secondly,
   what we understand by literary studies at the university; and thirdly,
   and more broadly, what constitutes cultural (beyond technical) literacy
   in the twenty-first century. This essay's final claim is that teaching
   e-it as DH effectively address all three.}},

   open-source online learning community. The Futures Initiative Commons in
   a Box site was developed and modified by the university faculty,
   graduate, and undergraduate students that make up the community of
   users. This learning community invites undergraduate and graduate
   students to become active knowledge-producers who contribute to their

Abstract = {{Despite being also known as the ``Father of Digital Humanities{''} owing
   to his pioneering contribution to the application of informatics to the
   whole ensemble of texts by the medieval philosopher and theologian
   Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), the Jesuit Italian priest Roberto Busa
   (1913-2011) has still not been fully appreciated with regard to his
   development of a ``hermeneutic informatics{''} {[}Busa 1999, 5]. Indeed
   this may represent a key concept to clarify what makes a difference
   between the common usage of computers in order to speed up procedures,
   and high-quality practices enhancing the role of informatics in shaping
   human interaction with machines. In other terms, Busa's interpretation
   of informatics may impact not only on the way in which digital resources
   and tools are developed, but also on the epistemological reflection
   about Digital Humanities. In this paper, by drawing from many of his
   texts, I will outline how this innovative ``hermeneutics{''} is
   explained by Busa in terms of language dynamisms potentially leading to
   the development of what Johanna Drucker has described as a
   ``humanistic-informed theory of the making of technology{''} {[}Drucker
   2012, 87].}},

Title = {{Diachronic trends in Homeric translations}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we intend to present a tool we developed for translation
   studies and diachronically compare various French translations of the
   Odyssey.
   This field of study is part of the more general ``Classical
   Receptions{''} studies that try to analyse the influence and adaptation
   of classical texts in modern and contemporary literature, theatre,
   cinema, and many other artistic fields. While Greek texts have been
   analysed by scholars for more than two thousand years, research about
   classical translations is not yet a most renown subject. In recent years
   this theme has raised a growing interest in the academic community.
   We developed a program that can align textual sequences (defined as
   groups of words delimited by a specified grammatical pivot, in our case
   proper nouns), without need of previous training. We obtained alignments
   for many different kinds of translations{[}1]. While other programs have
   an upper bound for one-to-many alignments (for example with a maximum of
   four translated elements aligned to the same original element) this
   algorithm allows an indefinite number of alignments, both for the source
   sequences and the target ones. The aligner is based on an implementation
   of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and on a string-based similarity approach
   to textual segments. The aligner needs to establish proper names as
   anchor words, as they are a relatively stable feature through different
   translations and tend to be similar in several languages.
   Thanks to the alignments obtained using the program, we can explore
   translations in a number of ways. We will illustrate the creation of a
   graphical interface to visualize French Homeric translations.
   With our tool, it is possible to highlight aligned portions of texts and
   show their immediate differences or similarities, both in meaning and in
   syntactic distribution.
   We will show some resulting syntactic analyses carried out on a small
   sample of texts, taken from a corpus of twenty-seven unabridged French
   translations of the Odyssey and explore how the study of diachronic
   translations through algorithms of computational linguistics can produce
   interesting results for literary and linguistic studies.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{For the past fifteen year, scholarly communication networks such as
   H-Soz-Kult -the German Information Service for Historians - and
   H-ArtHist - a specialized discussion and information network for art
   history based in Germany with an international reach - have been
   steadily publishing conference announcements and reports. Since both
   services were born digitally, starting with the listserv infrastructure
   of the Michigan based H-Net and later supplemented by database-driven
   web sites, the archives are easily accessible by electronic means. The
   aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the archives of scholarly
   communication provide a suitable basis for conducting an assessment of
   broad fields such as German historians or German art history, with
   relatively low technical effort. For the initial analysis of
   H-Soz-Kult{[}1], editorial practices facilitated the automated
   extraction of the speakers' names as a key feature. But even in cases
   where no such special markup has been applied, freely available Web
   services such as AlchemyAPI{[}2] provide methods that can be used to
   achieve comparable results.{[}3]}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{This paper approaches Corinne, ou l'Italie through an inter-disciplinary
   lens, drawing on literary, historical, and digital methodologies. If
   Corinne is first and foremost a Romantic novel that foregrounds the love
   plot between Corinne and Oswald, it is as much a novel about the role of
   women in society, articulated through the figure of the femme de genie.
   The plot of the femme de genie finds its expression through the trope of
   sociability, which I analyze through a social network analysis of the
   characters in the narrative and a computational analysis of collocates.
   I argue that through the constellation of sociability in the novel and
   the national allegories that accompany it, Stael evokes an enduring
   partiality for an Enlightenment ideal of sociability that remains deeply
   connected with female emancipation. The lens of sociability thus allows
   for a re-articulation of the novel as a social critique of patriarchal
   society.}},

Abstract = {{Three years after his death Friedrich Kittler's impact on the Humanities
   and Media Studies remains a topic of interest to scholars worldwide. The
   intellectual challenges presented by his theoretical work, however, are
   now complemented by the practical and archival difficulties of dealing
   with his personal digital legacy. How are we to preserve, survey and
   index the complex data collection Kittler bequeathed to the German
   Literature Archive in Marbach in the shape of old computers and hard
   drives? How are the Digital Humanities to handle the archive of one of
   its most important forefathers? To address these questions, this paper
   will first focus on the estate itself and then describe the design and
   development of the ``Indexer{''}, a tool for the initial indexing of
   technical information. Two especially problematic aspects are the sheer
   mass of files (more than 1.5 million) and Kittler's idiosyncratic
   organization, both of which serve to make conventional content
   evaluation very difficult. Here, the ``Indexer{''} has proven to be a
   powerful tool. Finally, a case study using the indexer's web interface
   will enable us to tackle the question: When and to what purpose did
   Friedrich Kittler acquire a computer?}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses exploratory search in large collections of
   historical texts. By way of example, we apply our method to a collection
   of documents comprising dossiers of the former East-German Ministry for
   State Security, and classical texts. The bases of our approach are topic
   models, a class of algorithms that define and infer themes pervading the
   corpus as probability distributions over the vocabulary. Our
   topic-centered visual metaphor supports to explore the corpus following
   an intuitive methodology: First, determine a topic of interest, second,
   suggest documents that contain the topic with ``sufficient{''}
   proportion, and third, browse iteratively through related topics and
   documents. Our main focus lies on providing a suitable bird's eye view
   onto the data to facilitate an in-depth analysis in terms of the topics
   contained.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{We propose that network visualization is a digital humanities method
   that can ``explore{''} and ``negotiate{''} the space between text and
   performance in the study of Shakespeare. The networks developed in this
   project use the language of Shakespearean plays to trace the
   relationships between characters in space, in effect, translating the
   literary text into a web of spatial relations, which are difficult to
   perceive solely in the act of reading. Our analysis presents a
   particular method of network visualization, and also demonstrates how
   this technique can be used as a critical tool to revise our
   understanding of social disorder in Shakespearean tragedy. We therefore
   propose a dual scope for this paper. At a methodological level, we argue
   that network visualization is a way to infer staging and the
   ``blocking{''} of theatrical space from the language of the playtext. In
   our case study, we show how this technique can be used as a form of
   Shakespearean literary criticism deploying this method to reframe the
   larger question of social disorder in his tragedies. The network
   visualizations used in this analysis serve as a stable and reproducible
   way, beyond any single performance, to delineate how the language of
   Shakespeare's plays structures the relationships of characters in space.
   This study represents the beginning of a digital method that aims to
   bridge text and performance in the study of Shakespeare by reading the
   dramatic text for the linguistic codes that organize the space of the
   stage.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we discuss a way for visualizing interactions or
   solidarities in a past community. The method that we expound is derived
   from process-oriented views used in the industry. Therefore, this
   attempt to adopt practices from outside of the traditional humanities
   framework must be clearly justified in terms of epistemological position
   and in terms of choice among the numerous available tools. First, we try
   to define what the process term could mean in the humanities; then we
   explain our choice of a representation; we also carry out tests of our
   method on selected case studies to visualize and question scholarly
   works. Last, we offer the reader a prototype that must be improved to
   produce automatic visualization of particular situations.}},

Title = {{Some principles for making collaborative scholarly editions in digital
   form}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{``Textual Communities{''} is a new system for managing and performing
   all aspects of an online collaborative scholarly editing project. It
   permits mounting of document images and offers page-bypage transcription
   and display, with the facility for project leaders to recruit and manage
   transcribers and other contributors, allocating and reviewing
   transcription work as it is done. Most distinctively, Textual
   Communities is built on a comprehensive model of scholarly editing,
   enabling both ``document{''} (page-by-page) and ``work{''} (intellectual
   structure, or ``entity{''}) views of the texts edited. Accordingly,
   multiple texts of a single work, or part of a work (an entity) may be
   extracted and compared, using an embedded installation of CollateX.
   While completely conformant with Text Encoding Initiative guidelines,
   Textual Communities goes beyond TEI and XML in its ability to handle
   multiple overlapping hierarchies within texts. This paper will outline
   the thinking behind the development of Textual Communities, and show
   examples of its use by several major projects.}},

Funding-Text = {{One of the most influential commentators on scholarly editing in the
   digital age, Jerome McGann, has frequently cited William Morris's
   observation that (in McGann's wording) ``you can't have art without
   resistance in the material.{''}{[} 2] There is danger in failing to
   resist: in editing, as in art, to do what is easiest may not be to do
   what is best. Following the scenario sketched in the last paragraph, we
   have seen the making of numerous ``digital documentary editions{''} {[}
   Pierazzo 2011], typically created with considerable funding and support
   from a digital humanities centre {[}Sutherland 2010] {[} Maryland 2014].
   The coincidence of cheap digital images, powerful encoding, and
   significant funding has resulted in several remarkable editions.
   However, there is a danger of imbalance, if many editions are made in a
   narrow band along the document/ text/ work axis, and for an ill- defined
   audience. Resistance in the materials entails not doing what is easiest.
   In scholarly editing terms: resistance means deciding where on the
   document/ text/ work continuum your edition should be located, not
   simply placing it where the technology makes it easiest, and identifying
   what audience you wish to serve, not simply satisfying your funder and
   your own inclinations.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{The William J. Bankes Archive, Dorchester, is an impressive collection
   of original material concerning the archaeological, anthropological and
   natural heritage of Nubia and was amassed in the years 1815-1822. In the
   last two hundred years, many geo-human factors caused radical changes in
   the region. In a landscape almost untouched for centuries, the signs of
   the interactions between the ancient human communities and the natural
   environment were much clearer in Bankes' times than now. Digital
   humanities offer powerful tools to manage and visualize large amounts of
   data and GIS in particular is an effective form of relational database,
   where all items of data have a position on the earth. This paper
   presents the methodology and the preliminary results of a research
   project that aims at a draft reconstruction of ancient Nubia based on
   the Bankes Archive. Archaeological, historical, natural history and
   ethnographic information extracted from the documents will be
   georeferenced in the GIS. Original maps, landscape views and epigraphic
   copies will also be made available on-line.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},

Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{It has recently become common to describe all empirical approaches to
   literature as subfields of digital humanities. This essay argues that
   distant reading has a largely distinct genealogy stretching back many
   decades before the advent of the internet - a genealogy that is not for
   the most part centrally concerned with computers. It would be better to
   understand this field as a conversation between literary studies and
   social science, inititated by scholars like Raymond Williams and Janice
   Radway, and moving slowly toward an explicitly experimental method.
   Candor about the social-scientific dimension of distant reading is
   needed now, in order to refocus a research agenda that can drift into
   diffuse exploration of digital tools. Clarity on this topic might also
   reduce miscommunication between distant readers and digital humanists.}},

Title = {{Fitting Personal Interpretation with the Semantic Web: lessons learned
   from Pliny}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we expand Stefan Gradmann's question at WWW2012 ``Thinking
   in the graph: will Digital Humanists ever do so?{''} to consider whether
   humanists, more generally than just ``digital{''} ones, might do
   thinking that is, at least to some useful degree, ``in the graph{''}
   too. Drawing on the experience of the Pliny project, and recent work
   done within that project to explore how Pliny materials might connect
   with the semantic web, we explore ways in which structured
   ``graph-like{''} thinking might be revealed in - to ``peek out{''} from
   - parts of humanities research that is common to digital and non-digital
   humanists alike. Out of this, we propose a number of different ways that
   scholars might engage with the Semantic Web, and provide examples
   arising from the building of a prototype extension to Pliny - of how
   these engagements could be dealt with. We also explore the challenge of
   ambiguity and incompleteness in scholarship, explain how 2D space
   operates in Pliny to cope, to some degree at least, with these issues,
   and consider the boundaries between the expressiveness of 2D space and
   the formal graph model of the Semantic Web. We end by proposing several
   possible avenues for future work that arise from our work so far.}},

Abstract = {{There are a number of fruitful digital humanities approaches to cinema
   and media studies, but most of them only pursue traditional forms of
   scholarship by extracting a single variable from the audiovisual text
   that is already legible to scholars. As an alternative, cinema and media
   studies should pursue a mostly-ignored ``digital surrealism{''} that
   uses computer-based methods to transform film texts in radical ways not
   previously possible. This article describes one such method using the
   z-projection function of the scientific image analysis software ImageJ
   to sum film frames in order to create new composite images. Working with
   the fifty-five feature-length films from Walt Disney Animation Studios,
   I describe how this method allows for a unique understanding of a film
   corpus not otherwise available to cinema and media studies scholars.}},

Abstract = {{James Patterson is the world's best-selling living author, but his
   approach to writing is heavily criticised for being too commercially

   marketing professional, Patterson uses his business acumen to drive
   sales of his novels, which are largely written in conjunction with
   lesser-known co-authors. Using stylometry, this paper analyses the
   extent to which Patterson actually contributes to the writing of his

Title = {{GIS and Literary History: Advancing Digital Humanities research through
   the Spatial Analysis of historical travel writing and topographical
   literature}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Exploratory studies have demonstrated the benefits of implementing
   Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology in literary and
   cultural-historical research. These studies have done much to affirm the
   power and flexibility of GIS technology as a resource for humanities
   scholarship. At the same time, however, these studies share a common
   limitation in that they tend to rely on the analysis of point-based
   cartographic representations. Such representations are suitable for
   modelling quantitative geographical phenomena, but they are inadequate
   for modelling qualitative human phenomena. This inadequacy constitutes a
   significant problem for researchers who aspire to analyse the
   geographical experiences and spatial relationships represented in works
   of literature, including works that contain accounts of travel. The
   present article proposes a solution to this problem by demonstrating how
   advanced spatial analyses within GIS such as Cost-Surface Analysis (CSA)
   and Least-Cost-Path Analysis (LCP) can be used to facilitate more
   nuanced interpretations of historical works of travel writing and
   topographical literature. Specifically, the article explains how GIS,
   CSA and LCP can be combined to build coherent spatial models of the
   journeys recorded in the works of three canonical eighteenth-century
   British travellers, each of whom composed influential accounts of their
   travels through the English Lake District: the poet Thomas Gray
   (1716-1771), the naturalist Thomas Pennant (1726-1798) and the
   agriculturist Arthur Young (1741-1820).}},

   DHML}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses the relationship of the disciplines of Modern
   Languages and Digital Humanities in Anglophone academia. It briefly
   compares and contrasts the nature of these ``disciplines{''} - most
   frequently conceived of as either inter- or transdisciplines - before
   going on to examine in some detail the participation of Modern Linguists
   in Digital Humanities and that of Digital Humanists in Modern Languages.
   It argues that, while there is growing evidence of work that crosses
   ``disciplinary{''} boundaries between DH and ML in both directions, more
   work of this sort needs to be done to optimise the potential of both
   disciplines. It also makes a particular case for Digital Humanities to
   remain open to critical cultural studies approaches to digital materials
   as pertaining to the discipline rather than focusing exclusively on more
   instrumental definitions of Digital Humanities. This argument is
   consistent with the concerns raised by other scholars with regard to the
   need for heterogeneity of approach and in particular for increased
   cultural criticism in Digital Humanities scholarship. Furthermore, we
   argue that this is where Modern Linguists can make their most decisive
   contribution to Digital Humanities research, offering what we term a
   ``critical DHML{''} approach. We illustrate our arguments with a range
   of examples from the intersection of ML and DH in the broad field of
   Hispanic Studies, including the major findings of our own research into
   digital cultural production in a Latin American context conducted over
   the last ten years.}},

Title = {{A Hybrid Model for Managing DH Projects}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{A project is a basic unit of digital humanities (DH) scholarship, which
   suggests that DH as a discipline should pay more attention to project
   management, and perhaps to develop the project management models,
   principles, and methods that are more specific to the discipline.
   However, DH literature deals with this issue merely by listing the basic
   principles, or offering specific ``tips and tricks,{''} which seriously
   simplifies management of DH projects. DH projects involve building (or
   at least using) digital tools, which brings the complex tensions between
   digital and humanistic aspects of these projects. In order to address
   such a complexity, there is a need for a model for managing DH projects
   that will learn from information studies and methods in software
   development, while still being based on values of the humanistic
   tradition and methods. This article combines a model of scholarly
   information practices with some concepts of agile software development
   into a hybrid model for managing DH projects.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},

Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{We present our use of the FSA-OWI Photographic Archive, a collection of
   over 170,000 photographs taken by the US Government between 1935 and
   1945, within Photogrammar as a case study of how to integrate
   methodological research into a digital, public project. Our work on the
   collection uses computational methods to extract new metadata
   surrounding individual photographs from the perspective of both the
   photographers and the original government archivists. Techniques for
   accomplishing this include mapping over an historical atlas, recreating
   historic cataloging systems, and digitally stitching together rolls of
   film. While many digital projects have focused on analysis at scale, our
   work on extracting new metadata actively demonstrates the power of
   digital techniques to assist in the close reading of even small sets of
   archival records. We conclude the article by describing how these
   contributions are presented in the Photogrammar site and describing the
   forms of collaboration needed to produce the final project.}},

Title = {{All and Each: A Socio-Technical Review of the Europeana Project}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},

Abstract = {{Digital technologies offer opportunities for engagement with cultural
   heritage resources through the development of online platforms and
   databases. However, questions have been raised about whether this type
   of engagement is structurally open or bounded by pre-existing
   institutional frameworks. Michel Foucault's later work on
   ``governmentality{''} speaks to this concern and identifies in modes of
   government the mutually reinforcing relation of all and each,{''} to
   develop those elements constitutive of individuals' lives in such a way
   that their development also fosters that of the strength of the
   state{''} {[}Foucault {[}1979] 2000a]. This article takes Foucault's
   insight as a point of departure for thinking about how digital
   technologies are mediating and structuring the relationships between
   individuals and organizations, using the European Commission-funded
   Europeana project as a case study. Europeana is the embodiment of all
   and each as a technique of government: it functions by fostering the
   contributions of individuals and national audiences in a way that
   celebrates their diversity, while also engaging in a project to
   systematically standardize and unify. Examination of the technical
   elements of Europeana reveals the political imperatives implicit in its
   technical operations, and how the parameters for audience participation
   are subsequently defined. In this article, we examine the audiences
   explicitly and implicitly delimited by Europeana, and then analyze them
   in relation to the project's development of the European Data Model
   (EDM) for the interchange of metadata about cultural heritage objects.
   The article concludes that a lack of explicit definitions about
   audiences, what Europeana is, and how its various parts work in concert
   constitute a definitional void. This void is a technique of government
   in that it absorbs difference and is deliberately vague. It involves
   power relations that are hard to center and render visible, and it is
   thus difficult to detect which actors are occupying a space of
   privilege. We suggest some tentative strategies for addressing this
   problem by attending to the sites of awkward engagement and difference
   that are currently masked in the technical framing of Europeana.}},

Abstract = {{We present a case study on visualizing a collection of historic drawings
   along its metadata structure while also allowing for close examination
   of the artifacts' texture. With regards to the specific character of
   cultural heritage at the intersection of research, education, and public
   interest, the presented visualization environment aims at meeting the
   requirements of both researchers as well as a broader public. We present
   the results from a collaborative interdisciplinary research project that
   involved a cultural heritage foundation, art historians, designers, and
   computer scientists. The case study examines the potential of
   visualization when applied to, and developed for, cultural heritage
   collections. It specifically explores how techniques aimed at
   visualizing the quantitative structure of a collection can be coupled
   with a more qualitative mode that allows for detailed examination of the
   artifacts and their contexts by displaying high-resolution views of
   digitized cultural objects with detailed art historical research
   findings. Making use of latest web technologies, the resulting
   visualization environment allows for dynamic filtering and zooming of a
   collection of visual resources that are arranged along a contextualized
   timeline. We share insights from our collaborative design process and
   the feedback and usage data gathered during the deployment of the
   resulting prototype as a web application. We end with a discussion of
   transferability of carefully crafted and collaboratively negotiated
   visualizations of cultural heritage and raise questions concerning the
   applicability of our approach to related strands of humanities research.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Humanities (DH) methods incorporated into traditional (non-DH)
   humanities classrooms present a fruitful opportunity to help
   undergraduate students learn digital literacy skills as well as new ways
   of studying the humanities. In light of the trend of increasing numbers
   of women entering higher education and choosing humanities and arts
   degrees, DH can also help women who potentially face gender biases
   related to digital technology gain competence and confidence with it
   through their humanities courses. Having more students introduced to DH
   as a regular part of study may increase diversity in the DH community
   when they themselves become teachers and researchers. Barriers exist,
   from reluctance to change to a rising contingent labor force. Therefore,
   this article offers a selection of accessible DH methods that can be
   used to positively shape humanities pedagogy.}},

   primarily methodological: several different issues are presented,
   starting with the fact that the University of Bologna website has been
   excluded for thirteen years from the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine,
   and possible solutions are proposed and applied. Moreover, this study
   aims at highlighting how web materials could give us new and distinct

Title = {{Automated Pattern Analysis in Gesture Research: Similarity Measuring in
   3D Motion Capture Models of Communicative Action}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{The question of how to model similarity between gestures plays an
   important role in current studies in the domain of human communication.
   Most research into recurrent patterns in co-verbal gestures - manual
   communicative movements emerging spontaneously during conversation - is
   driven by qualitative analyses relying on observational comparisons
   between gestures. Due to the fact that these kinds of gestures are not
   bound to well-formedness conditions, however, we propose a quantitative
   approach consisting of a distance-based similarity model for gestures
   recorded and represented in motion capture data streams. To this end, we
   model gestures by flexible feature representations, namely gesture
   signatures, which are then compared via signature-based distance
   functions such as the Earth Mover's Distance and the Signature Quadratic
   Form Distance. Experiments on real conversational motion capture data
   evidence the appropriateness of the proposed approaches in terms of
   their accuracy and efficiency. Our contribution to gesture similarity
   research and gesture data analysis allows for new quantitative methods
   of identifying patterns of gestural movements in human face-to-face
   interaction, i.e., in complex multimodal data sets.}},

Title = {{OCR of historical printings with an application to building diachronic
   corpora: A case study using the RIDGES herbal corpus}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the results of a case study that applies Neural
   Network-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to scanned images of
   books printed between 1487 and 1870 by training the OCR engine OCRopus
   {[}Breuel et al. 2013] on the RIDGES herbal text corpus {[}Odebrecht et
   al. 2017] (in press). Training specific OCR models was possible because
   the necessary ground truth is available as error-corrected diplomatic
   transcriptions. The OCR results have been evaluated for accuracy against
   the ground truth of unseen test sets. Character and word accuracies
   (percentage of correctly recognized items) for the resulting
   machine-readable texts of individual documents range from 94\% to more
   than 99\% (character level) and from 76\% to 97\% (word level). This
   includes the earliest printed books, which were thought to be
   inaccessible by OCR methods until recently. Furthermore, OCR models
   trained on one part of the corpus consisting of books with different
   printing dates and different typesets (mixed models) have been tested
   for their predictive power on the books from the other part containing
   yet other fonts, mostly yielding character accuracies well above 90\%.
   It therefore seems possible to construct generalized models trained on a
   range of fonts that can be applied to a wide variety of historical
   printings still giving good results. A moderate postcorrection effort of
   some pages will then enable the training of individual models with even
   better accuracies. Using this method, diachronic corpora including early
   printings can be constructed much faster and cheaper than by manual
   transcription. The OCR methods reported here open up the possibility of
   transforming our printed textual cultural heritage into electronic text
   by largely automatic means, which is a prerequisite for the mass
   conversion of scanned books.}},

Abstract = {{Early modern printed books pose particular challenges for automatic
   transcription: uneven inking, irregular orthographies, radically
   multilingual texts. As a result, modern efforts to transcribe these
   documents tend to produce the textual gibberish commonly known as
   ``dirty OCR{''} (Optical Character Recognition). This noisy output is
   most frequently seen as a barrier to access for scholars interested in
   the computational analysis or digital display of transcribed documents.
   This article, however, proposes that a closer analysis of dirty OCR can
   reveal both historical and cultural factors at play in the practice of
   automatic transcription. To make this argument, it focuses on tools
   developed for the automatic transcription of the Primeros Libros
   collection of sixteenth century Mexican printed books. By bringing
   together the history of the collection with that of the OCR tool, it
   illustrates how the colonial history of these documents is embedded in,
   and transformed by, the statistical models used for automatic
   transcription. It argues that automatic transcription, itself a
   mechanical and practical tool, also has an interpretive effect on
   transcribed texts that can have practical consequences for scholarly
   work.}},

Abstract = {{In the Digital Humanities, there is a fast-growing body of research that
   uses data visualization to explore the structures of language. While new
   techniques are proliferating they still fall short of offering whole
   language experimentation. We provide a mathematical technique that maps
   words and symbols to ordered unique numerical values, showing that this
   mapping is one-to-one and onto. We demonstrate this technique through
   linear, planar, and volumetric visualizations of data sets as large as
   the Oxford English Dictionary and as small as a single poem. The
   visualizations of this space have been designed to engage the viewer in
   the analogic practice of comparison already in use by literary critics
   but on a scale inaccessible by other means. We studied our visualization
   with expert participants from many fields including English studies,
   Information Visualization, Human-Computer Interaction, and Computer
   Graphics. We present our findings from this study and discuss both the
   criticisms and validations of our approach.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{The field of humanities has now grown into a digital environment
   challenging educators and scholars to create, manipulate, and curate
   data for research and instruction. The humanities is faced with a
   digital medium that is changing the way scholars conduct their
   exploration of research. This study encourages the examination of
   imagery through qualitative coding, or annotation, to reveal themes and
   visual stories to further unravel the layers of a visual object. Images
   from the work of 1960s pop artists James Rosenquist and Roy Lichtenstein
   were evaluated using ATLAS.ti to determine common themes, visual
   stories, and aesthetic differences. Qualitative coding is usually
   associated with textual data, but using a software analysis tool such as
   ATLAS.ti can centralize the collection of data to efficiently code
   imagery, text, audio, and video. This case study will be used to
   introduce researchers, faculty, and students to qualitative analysis
   tools and the usefulness of coding to reveal themes in imagery.
   Furthermore, librarians have an opportunity to facilitate the learning
   of these tools in combination with the various proprietary and open
   access image databases housed in the library.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a study of 1,439 users of British
   History Online (BHO). BHO is a digital library of key printed primary
   and secondary sources for the history of Britain and Ireland, with a
   principal focus on the period between 1300 and 1800. The collection
   currently contains 1,250 volumes, and 120,000 web pages of material.
   During a website rebuild in 2014, the project team asked its registered
   users about their preferences for searching and browsing the content in
   the collection. Respondents were asked about their current search and
   browsing behaviour, as well as their receptiveness to new navigation
   options, including fuzzy searching, proximity searching, limiting search
   to a subset of the collection, searching by publication metadata, and
   searching entities within the texts such as person names, place names,
   or footnotes. The study provides insight into the unique and often
   converging needs of the site's academic and genealogical users, noting
   that the former tended to respond in favour of options that gave them
   greater control over the search process, whereas the latter generally
   opted for options to improve the efficacy of targeted keyword searching.
   Results and recommendations are offered.}},

Abstract = {{Recent State of the Union addresses have included a number of new visual
   elements, including a running slide show and interactive social media
   cards. This paper poses a method for collecting and analyzing these new
   visual elements and incorporating the results of that study into the
   study of presidential Rhetoric. This article will: (1) situate the
   enhanced State of the Union within the study of presidential rhetoric,
   (2) combine aspects of close and distant reading for critique of the
   address, (3) provide the results of the approach to distant reading
   taken here, and (4) discuss the implications of the analysis of this
   particular visual program as they afford future annual addresses

Title = {{A Macroscope for Global History: Seshat Global History Databank, a
   methodological overview}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{This article introduces the ``Seshat: Global History{''} project, the
   methodology it is based upon and its potential as a tool for historians
   and other humanists. Seshat is a comprehensive dataset covering human
   cultural evolution since the Neolithic. The article describes in detail
   how the Seshat methodology and platform can be used to tackle big
   questions that play out over long time scales whilst allowing users to
   drill down to the detail and place every single data point both in its
   historic and historiographical context. Seshat thus offers a platform
   underpinned by a rigorous methodology to actually do longue duree
   history and the article argues for the need for humanists and social
   scientists to engage with data driven longue duree history. The article
   argues that Seshat offers a much-needed infrastructure in which
   different skill sets and disciplines can come together to analyze the
   past using long timescales. In addition to highlighting the theoretical
   and methodological underpinnings, Seshat's potential is demonstrated
   using three case studies. Each of these case studies is centred around a
   set of longstanding questions and historiographical debates and it is
   argued that the introduction of a Seshat approach has the potential to
   radically alter our understanding of these questions.}},

Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{This study examines the extent of the use of geographic code words in
   place of racial terms in daily news reporting. This is a case study of
   the only daily newspaper, the Toledo Blade, in the midwestern city of
   Toledo, Ohio. A data set was constructed by searching a nine year
   collection of Blade articles, available in full-text searchable format
   in a ProQuest database, that included the most frequently used
   directional terms and had specific street addresses (a total of 981
   stories). Besides bibliographic data, each story was coded for its
   location and the general nature of the story. Street addresses were used
   to compile relevant census tract information on the proportion of
   minorities in each area referenced. These references were then plotted
   over a street map of Toledo revealing geographic distributions that do
   not relate to actual cardinal directions. Population data corresponding
   to each data point was then analyzed to show that directional
   terminology correlates with the concentration of minority population.
   Additionally, a comprehensive content analysis of all 21,667 Blade
   articles published in this period revealed racial differences in
   reporting. Such quantified observations are reinforced by examination of
   particular examples of racialized usage of geographic terms.}},

   cultural material and processes. The argument is made first by examining
   the case of information sharing within DIY culture as an expression of
   current day cultural material. Secondly, it illustrated how traditional
   humanities scholarship, such as reading ancient documents, compares to
   it's DIY equivalent within family history circles, and how both will
   continue to use digital and non-digital methods.}},

   John Casti lays out the history, methods and evolution of simple and

   of examples, ranging from football simulators to internal computer
   warfare between lines of code. Casti presents a framework approach to

   fosters in his reader an appreciation of the fundamentals: how such

Title = {{Circling around texts and language: towards ``pragmatic modelling{''} in
   Digital Humanities}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we introduce the syntagm ``pragmatic modelling{''} as a
   productive way of contextualising research in Digital Humanities (DH).
   We define ``pragmatic modelling{''} as a middle-out approach (neither
   top down nor bottom up) that combines formal and experimental modelling
   techniques with an effective use of language. Furthermore, in order to
   elucidate a ``pragmatic understanding{''} of model building, we reflect
   on texts (considered here as objects) and modelling (or strategy of
   analysis) in DH research (and teaching). This paper does not identify a
   new practice or approach; rather it offers an explanatory framework for
   existing practices. As the paper explains, this framework goes beyond
   existing ones and allows us to think about modelling in a more integral
   way. Drawing on this framework, we reveal how DH modelling practices
   challenge epistemological and linguistic restrictions, by, for example,
   problematising the adoption of terminology belonging to the domain of
   computer sciences. Reflections on metaphorical reasoning are used to
   exemplify how polarities and some rigidities DH research could find
   itself embedded in are overcome in practice. We conclude by advocating
   the importance of a diachronic and historical analysis of the role of
   metaphors in DH to further explore the relation between theory and
   practice as well as to develop models of modelling integral to DH
   research.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},

Abstract = {{Digital humanities scholars have made a tradition of problematizing our
   understanding of textuality through discussions concerning the design of
   information systems for texts that, in many cases, still look like
   books. This discussion is concerned with how creating opportunities for
   studying audio texts further complicates our understanding of ``the
   rationale of a textualized document,{''} defined by Jerome McGann as
   ``the dynamic structure of a document as it is realized in determinate
   (artisanal) and determinable (reflective) ways{''}. This discussion
   frames a rationale of audio text within the context of developing
   information infrastructures for accessing audio texts. I introduce a
   tool called ARLO that we have been developing in the High Performance
   Sound Technologies for Access and Scholarship (HiPSTAS) project
   (http://www.hipstas.org) for accessing and analyzing sound collections
   alongside new standards being proposed for the development of audio
   visual (AV) metadata and content models. The discussion concludes by
   considering what these interventions tell us about how a rationale of
   audio textuality helps us rethink rationales of text in digital
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Covers and bindings are collapsing in the digital textual world. To
   begin with, the following paper argues that this is not a genuinely new
   situation, since all cultural Western history attests to written texts
   as never having been autonomous from oral discourses and versioning
   steps. Thenceforth - after analyzing the relationship between paper and
   body, relying notably on Derrida - this article will claim that we have
   the right and indeed, an obligation, to ``capture{''} new covers and
   bindings. During the 17th century, in the lawless parts of the ocean,
   buccaneers realized that the right to depart was the condition for the
   capacity to be bound. Therefore, let us dare to depart from ancient
   bindings and create new boundaries.}},

   historic research and Digital Humanities we aim to extract, classify and
   quantify events in a way that preserves their inherent multiplicity and

   seen as a means to mediate events rather than a classical media-centred
   tradition to preserve an authorized version of cultural heritage.}},

Title = {{The Printing Press as Metaphor}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{These days, we are constantly looking for an image of ourselves in the
   historical past. ``The first ever information revolution,{''} begins a
   typical book jacket blurb, ``began with the advent of the printed book,
   enabling Renaissance scholars to formulate new ways of organizing and
   disseminating knowledge{''} {[}Sawday and Rhodes 2000]. A communications
   scholar offers a view of our place in history that has echoes in
   countless other publications and presentations: ``At present we are
   witnessing an information revolution whose significance parallels and
   perhaps even surpasses that of the information revolution caused by the
   printing press in the fifteenth century{''} {[}Jucker 2003, 129].
   Publishers, both academic and trade, have created a new genre of book
   titles that confidently find the digital sizzle in the analog past: The
   Renaissance Computer (on printed books), The Victorian Internet (on the
   telegraph), Social Media: The First 2,000 Years (on letters, pamphlets,
   and graffiti). Scholars give talks with titles like ``Books as Social
   Media{''} (Leah Price), ``Blogging Now and Then (250 Years Ago){''}
   (Robert Darnton), and ``What's in a Visitor's Book? Social Media and
   Volcanic Tourism in the Nineteenth Century{''} (John Brewer).
   Surrounded as we are by these analogies-by these claims in favor of
   specific ways of construing the relationship between the past and the
   present, and by the significance claims that go with them-it seems fair
   to ask what purposes they serve. There is no doubt that we feel
   ourselves to be in the midst of a period of dramatic change in our media
   and information environments. My interest in this essay lies not in
   these environments themselves, but rather in our popular uses of
   historical metaphor to explain them. Why, in particular, do we turn to
   the rise of the printing press, out of all the options available, as our
   standard analogy for the rise of the internet? What value does this
   metaphor hold for us, what does it enable and what does it constrain,
   and what value does metaphoric thinking in general hold for analysis in
   media studies? It is as common for us today to use the printing press as
   a unit of measure in estimations of information history as it is for us
   to discuss our current circumstances in terms of an information
   revolution. But how historically accurate are these kinds of
   description? What do they mean for the ways in which we as futurists
   make use of history-and what do they mean for the ways in which we as
   historians take the long view?}},

Title = {{It is time to address the Public Communication of DH}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This introduction addresses two facets of the communication of Digital
   Humanities (DH) that have framed this special edition of DHQ. I begin by
   discussing a number of articles about DH that have relatively recently
   appeared in mainstream newspapers. I then observe that a number of these
   articles not only show an impoverished understanding of the field's
   frame of reference but also misrepresent various aspects of it, for
   example, its interrelationship with the Humanities. Given that many
   academic publications on the question ``what is DH?{''} have appeared in
   recent years, yet DH is, nonetheless, misrepresented in this way, I
   propose that the field must look again at the communication of its
   activities ``in the round.{''} Now that DH is arguably moving from the
   margins to the mainstream I propose that the time has come to address
   what we might call the ``Public Communication of DH{''} so that we can
   better communicate to the general public and academics working in other
   disciplines what it is that we do. As the nature of DH's relationship to
   the Humanities is one that is frequently misrepresented in the
   mainstream media I propose that this would be an important area for
   endeavours in the ``Public Communication of DH{''} to address and
   explore as early as possible. The articles included in this special
   edition enrich and expand ongoing conversations about the nature of this
   relationship. In doing so they make available a wealth of case studies,
   arguments and insights that can, in due course, be drawn on to further
   the ``Public Communication of DH.{''}}},

Title = {{The App-Maker Model: An Embodied Expansion of Mobile Cyberinfrastructure}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{With the Maker Movement promoting a refreshing DIY ethic in regard to
   creation and epistemology, the time might be ripe for scholars to adopt
   such techniques into their own research, particularly in the subfield of
   mobile communication studies. One can now relatively easily participate
   in the building and implementation of a variety of digital products,
   such as mobile apps, that can then be used to study user experiences
   through interactions with rhetorical forms, including a variety of types
   of informatics. Our experiences in several projects that use both large-
   and small-scale mobile apps offer a critique and lessons learned
   directly from engaging in this type of field experimentation, including
   reflections on observations, survey responses, and other types of data
   collection made possible through this model. Four larger issues are
   addressed here, about conducting research through making apps, providing
   potential research paths, opportunities and challenges to consider.
   Perhaps most importantly, this research approach offers the ability to
   tailor an instrument specific to research needs and then test that
   instrument in a natural setting, affording a true sense of how people
   interact with their environments in real situations and real settings.}},

Abstract = {{For the past century, the sciences have made terrific strides in
   capturing the public imagination. From dedicated television channels to
   online learning materials to science-related entertainment and
   educational facilities for families in practically every major city on
   the planet, the scale of public relations has been impressive and
   continuous. However, the same cannot be said for the Humanities.
   Although we certainly have cultural institutions for adults, ranging
   from art galleries to opera houses, their primary emphasis has been on
   providing opportunities for passively consuming cultural production,
   rather than with the core interest of the Humanities, which is in
   enriching objects of study by analyzing them through a variety of
   theoretical lenses. In this paper, I argue, as others have been doing
   for some time, that the Humanities need to learn in this respect from
   the sciences, in order to increase their public stature. Further, the
   driving force behind this education is Digital Humanities. Since public
   relations has been on the back burner for so long, this initiative is
   both important and daunting; it is one of the ways in which the Digital
   Humanities are strengthening the Humanities while at the same time
   encouraging them in a task that seems difficult enough that everyone
   wishes it was not necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Historians have argued that nationalism spread from elite groups to
   larger populations through public media, yet this has never been
   empirically proven. In this paper, we use digital tools to search for
   expressions of nationalism in Dutch newspaper discourse in the late
   nineteenth century by text mining in large newspaper repositories. The
   absence of emotional nationalist rhetoric in Dutch national newspapers
   suggests that nationalism in the late nineteenth century was much more
   subtle than the literature based on elite discourse tells us.}},

Title = {{Six Degrees of Francis Bacon: A Statistical Method for Reconstructing
   Large Historical Social Networks}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we present a statistical method for inferring historical
   social networks from biographical documents as well as the scholarly
   aims for doing so. Existing scholarship on historical social networks is
   scattered across an unmanageable number of disparate books and articles.
   A researcher interested in how persons were connected to one another in
   our field of study, early modern Britain (c. 1500-1700), has no global,
   unified resource to which to turn. Manually building such a network is
   infeasible, since it would need to represent thousands of nodes and tens
   of millions of potential edges just to include the relations among the
   most prominent persons of the period. Our Six Degrees of Francis Bacon
   project takes up recent statistical techniques and digital tools to
   reconstruct and visualize the early modern social network.
   We describe in this paper the natural language processing tools and
   statistical graph learning techniques that we used to extract names and
   infer relations from the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. We
   then explain the steps taken to test inferred relations against the
   knowledge of experts in order to improve the accuracy of the learning
   techniques. Our argument here is twofold: first, that the results of
   this process, a global visualization of Britain's early modern social
   network, will be useful to scholars and students of the period; second,
   that the pipeline we have developed can, with local modifications, be
   reused by other scholars to generate networks for other historical or
   contemporary societies from biographical documents.}},

   representation is intriguing for Digital Humanities research, teaching,
   and practice. However, scholars, researchers, and artists may lack

Title = {{TaDiRAH: a Case Study in Pragmatic Classification}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Classifying and categorizing the activities that comprise ``digital
   humanities{''} has been a longstanding area of interest for many
   practitioners in this field, fueled by ongoing attempts to define
   digital humanities both within the academy and in the public sphere. The
   emergence of directories that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries
   has also spurred interest in categorization, with the practical goal of
   helping scholars identify, for instance, projects that take a similar
   technical approach, even if their subject matter is vastly different.
   This paper tracks the development of TaDiRAH, the Taxonomy of Digital
   Research Activities in the Humanities developed by representatives from
   DARIAH, the European cyberinfrastructure initiative, and DiRT, a digital
   humanities tool directory. TaDiRAH was created specifically to connect
   people with information on DiRT and in a DARIAH-DE bibliography, but
   with the goal of adoption by other directory-like sites. To ensure that
   TaDiRAH would be usable by other projects, the developers opened drafts
   for public feedback, a process which fundamentally altered the structure
   of the taxonomy and improved it in numerous ways. By actively seeking
   feedback from the digital humanities community and reviewing data about
   how the source taxonomies are actually used in order to inform term
   selection, the development of TaDiRAH provides a model that may benefit
   other taxonomy efforts.}},

   the Digital Realm}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{The Almanac Archive, a project in its early stages of development, seeks
   to create a corpus of annotated British almanacs from 1750-1850. Cheap
   and useful, the almanac was one of the most commonly purchased and
   frequently read print genres during the eighteenth and nineteenth
   centuries. By focusing on readers' annotations in almanacs about
   everything from social engagements and weather to historical events and
   the breeding of livestock, The Almanac Archive offers insights into
   everyday life and ideologies of time. Creating a searchable, digital
   corpus of high-resolution images from annotated almanacs will encourage
   new research questions about the relationship between historical events,
   individuals' everyday lives, and the materiality of Romantic-era
   interfaces for tracking time. By theorizing and sharing the ultimate
   goals and, indeed, challenges of the project even at its early stages,
   our aim in this paper is to answer Johanna Drucker's call to pay
   ``{[}m]ore attention to acts of producing and {[}to put] less emphasis
   on product{''} during ``the creation of an interface{''} in order ``to
   expose and support the activity of interpretation, rather than to
   display finished forms{''} {[}Drucker 2013, 42]. In openly describing
   the unfinished form of The Almanac Archive and its relationship to
   current scholarly trends, we outline the technical and theoretical work
   going into its creation.}},

Title = {{Word Processor Art: How ``User-friendly{''} Inhibits Creativity}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{My paper contains original ``Word Processor Art{''} compositions and an
   explanation of the theoretical grounding for my work. I compose visual
   images (comprised of words primarily taken from advertisements about the
   object they construct) in a program not intended for that purpose
   (Microsoft Word). I break from the expected form of the ``Word Processor
   Document{''} to scrutinize how machines, especially computer programs
   and the graphical user interface (GUI), influence the consumer's
   utilization of computers. In particular, my project questions how
   machines influence users' thinking and how the ``user-friendly{''}
   inhibits creativity. The process disassembles the notion of
   ``user-friendly{''} as a transparent influence and reveals how media
   shapes the author's imagination and creations.
   The ever-present PC, in many ways, parallels the presence of the
   typewriter in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, which led artists to experiment
   with the grid-like form of mechanical type to create concrete and,
   eventually, dirty concrete poetry. My work is inspired by these artists
   and the typewriter poetry they composed. My work also references art
   collective JODI's compositions and how our contemporary society resists
   the limitations of the GUI.
   My intent is to draw attention to the media of the composition. My work
   disobeys the prompts of the GUI to emphasize the idea that pre-packaged
   programs elicit conditioned responses and stifle genuinely creative uses
   of computing devices. Nietzsche writes that ``our writing tools are also
   working on our thoughts{''} (quoted in {[}Kittler 1986, 200]). My
   purpose in producing this work is not a rejection of computing or the
   GUI, but to draw attention to an interface's existence and influence on
   its user. My work points to a creative space outside of conditioned
   responses to the GUI.}},

Abstract = {{Humanistic uses of digital technologies have opened up new ways to think
   about, communicate, and discuss historical research. The common use of
   digital tools to visually represent ancient cultures and sites, however,
   has also introduced new issues. For example, critics have argued that
   digital visualisations, largely synonymous with reconstruction in 3D
   models, often attempt to represent a photorealistic-artificial vision of
   the past, and may often prove to be a way to communicate history to a
   large(r) audience {[}Forte and Siliotti 1997]. Against this backdrop,
   this article will discuss precisely how technology may help immerse
   researchers into historically situated life, and radically advance
   historical research. Adding to related criticisms of ocularcentric
   traditions of knowledge production, we contribute to this stream of
   research by arguing that contemporary visual representations of the past
   often concentrate on visual representations and seemingly maintain
   antiquity as a sanitised historio-cultural ideal {[}Westin 2012]
   {[}Tziovas 2014]. More specifically, this article seeks to demonstrate
   the potential of digital humanities to move beyond mere representations
   on screen and to mobilize other senses (specifically sound) as a
   historically situated component for research. For this purpose, we focus
   on the abstract principles and overall methodology for a recreation of
   the experience of sounds in the Roman amphitheatre.}},

Abstract = {{``From Kindling to Kindles{''} is a review of Matt Hayler's Challenging

   (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015). Hayler's text is an
   investigation into the current theoretical framework surrounding our
   contemporary usage of the term ``technology.{''} To do this Challenging
   the Phenomena of Technology moves through how we define technology, why
   the same artefacts might be fundamentally different for different users,
   how this might change our understanding of embodied knowledge, and
   finally places these issues into a nonhuman context. The book offers
   exemplary accounts of how to tackle interdisciplinary concerns that
   relate to so many aspects of our lives.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{The Hellespont project (DAI, Tufts University) aims to structure the
   text of a passage from the ancient Greek historian Thucydides
   (1.89-118), in order to highlight events, persons and peoples that
   populate the world of the author and connect the different digital
   sources available for their study. Event annotation in the text in
   particular requires an in-depth linguistic analysis of morphology,
   syntax and semantics. However, the available resources for Ancient Greek
   do not provide adequate standards to support the encoding of semantic
   and pragmatic phenomena in Ancient Greek texts. In this paper, we
   discuss the motivation of the project and how we adapted the so called
   tectogrammatical annotation of the Prague Dependency Treebank to
   identify the events and describe their structure. The linguistic notion
   of valency, which is central to tectogrammatical sentence
   representation, proves very useful for this analysis of Ancient Greek.}},

Title = {{Exploring Citation Networks to Study Intertextuality in Classics}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Referring constitutes such an essential scholarly activity across
   disciplines that it has been regarded by {[}Unsworth 2000] as one of the
   scholarly primitives. In Classics, in particular, the references to
   passages of the ancient texts - the so-called canonical citations (or
   references) - play a prominent role. The potential of these citations,
   however, has not been fully exploited to date, despite the attention
   that they have recently received in the field of Digital Humanities.
   In this paper I discuss two aspects of making such citations computable.
   Firstly, I illustrate how they can be extracted from text by using
   Natural Language Processing techniques, especially Named Entity
   Recognition. Secondly, I discuss the creation of a three-level citation
   network to formalise the web of relations between texts that canonical
   references implicitly constitute. As I outline in the conclusive section
   of this paper, the possible uses of the extracted citation network
   include the development of search applications and recommender systems
   for bibliography; the enhancement of digital environments to read
   primary sources with links to related secondary literature; and the
   application of these network to the study of intertextuality and text
   reception.}},

Abstract = {{Over a decade ago, the Collaboratory for GIS and Mediterranean (CGMA)
   was created with two stated goals: (1) to create an on-line GIS
   inventory of survey projects in the greater Mediterranean and Europe and
   (2) to introduce advanced undergraduates to GIS concepts through
   Mediterranean archaeology. Through a specialized GIS course a small
   group of advanced undergraduate students learned how to interpret map
   data, create effective maps, and build map hypothesis - skills that are
   recognized as necessary for enhancing spatial thinking and thus spatial
   literacy. In the last decade GIS technologically has changed
   dramatically. The advent of Geospatial Semantic Web (Web 2.0) now makes
   it possible to integrate spatial thinking concepts at all levels of the
   undergraduate curriculum. This paper argues that spatial literacy must
   be more intentionally integrated into the Classical Studies curriculum
   and illustrates how we have begun to do that at DePauw University.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{This article critiques the rhetoric of openness, accessibility and
   collaboration that features largely in digital humanities literature by
   examining the status of student labour, training, and funding within the
   discipline. The authors argue that the use of such rhetoric masks the
   hierarches that structure academic spaces, and that a shift to the
   digital does not eliminate these structural inequalities. Drawing on two
   surveys that assess student participation in DH projects (one for
   students, and one for faculty researchers), the article outlines the
   challenges currently faced by students working in the field, and
   suggests a set of best practices that might bridge the disparity between
   rhetoric and reality.}},

   Humanities at the University of Leipzig, the Perseus Digital Library at
   Tufts University, and the Harvard Center for Hellenic Studies to produce
   a new open series of Greek and Latin fragmentary authors. Such authors
   are lost and their works are preserved only thorugh quotations and text
   reuses by later texts. The project is undertaking two tasks: 1) the
   digitization of paper editions of fragmentary works linking them to the
   source texts from which the fragments have been excerpted; 2) the
   production of born-digital editions of fragmentary works. The ultimate
   goals are the creation of open, linked, machine-actionable texts for the
   study and advancement of the Classical textual fragmentary heritage and
   the development of a collaborative environment for crowdsourced
   annotations.}},

Abstract = {{In this article it is argued that one of the major transformative
   factors of the humanities at the beginning of the 21st century is the
   shift from analogue to digital source material, and that this shift will
   affect the humanities in a variety of ways. But various kinds of digital
   material are not digital in the same way, which a distinction between
   digitized, born-digital, and reborn-digital may help us acknowledge,
   thereby helping us to understand how each of these types of digital
   material affects different phases of scholarly work in its own way. This
   is illustrated by a detailed comparison of the nature of digitized

Abstract = {{The presentation, publication and research platforms used for scholarly
   work in the Digital Humanities embody argument structures that are not
   always explicitly acknowledged. This article examines these platforms,
   and their protocols, as ``middleware{''} that includes such
   purpose-designed projects as Omeka, and Scalar, and general purpose ones
   such as Drupal and PowerPoint, to ask how they embody rhetorical
   assumptions at every level of production (from back-end assumptions
   about what constitutes the smallest unit of discourse, to the front-end
   modes of presentation and organization of display). It extends the
   concept of middleware to include physical and social presentation
   spaces, activities (such as witnessing), to ask how these, also, perform
   the rhetorical activity of enunciation, positionality, and other
   discursive modalities.}},

Abstract = {{Coptic represents the last phase of the Egyptian language and is pivotal
   for a wide range of disciplines, such as linguistics, biblical studies,
   the history of Christianity, Egyptology, and ancient history. It was
   also essential for ``cracking the code{''} of the Egyptian hieroglyphs.
   Although digital humanities has been hailed as distinctly
   interdisciplinary, enabling new forms of knowledge by combining multiple
   forms of disciplinary investigation, technical obtacles exist for
   creating a resource useful to both linguists and historians, for
   example. The nature of the language (outside of the Indo-European
   family) also requires its own approach. This paper will present some of
   the challenges - both digital and material - in creating an online, open
   source platform with a database and tools for digital research in
   Coptic. It will also propose standards and methodologies to move forward
   through those challenges. This paper should be of interest not only to
   scholars in Coptic but also others working on what are traditionally
   considered more ``marginal{''} language groups in the pre-modern world,
   and researchers working with corpora that have been removed from their
   original ancient or medieval repositories and fragmented or dispersed.}},

Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{This article demonstrates the use of data mining methodologies for the
   study and research of social media in the digital humanities. Drawing
   from recent convergences in writing, rhetoric, and DH research, this
   article investigates how trends operate within complex networks. Through
   a study of trend data mined from Twitter, this article suggests the
   possibility of identifying a virality threshold for Twitter trends, and
   the possibility that such a threshold has broader implications for
   attention ecology research in the digital humanities. This article
   builds on the theories of Jacques Derrida, Richard Lanham, and Sidney
   Dobrin to suggest new theories and methodologies for understanding how
   attention operates within complex media ecologies at a macroscopic
   level. While many various theories and methods have investigated
   writing, rhetoric, and digital media at the microscopic level, this
   article contends that a complimentary macroscopic approach is needed to
   further investigate how attention functions for network culture.}},

Title = {{Information access in the art history domain: Evaluating a federated
   search engine for Rembrandt research}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{The art history domain is an interesting case for search engines
   tailored to the digital humanities, because the domain involves
   different types of sources (primary and secondary; text and images). One
   example of an art history search engine is RemBench, which provides
   access to information in four different databases related to the life
   and works of Rembrandt van Rijn. In the current paper, RemBench serves
   as a case to (1) discover the requirements for a search engine that is
   geared towards the art history domain and (2) make recommendations for
   the design of user observation studies for evaluating the usability of a
   search engine in the art history domain, and in digital humanities at
   large.
   A user observation study with nine participants confirms that the
   combination of different source types is crucial in the art history
   domain. With respect to the user interface, both free-text search and
   facet filtering are actively used by the observed participants but we
   observe strong individual preferences. Our key recommendation for
   specialized search engines is the use of faceted search (free text
   search combined with filtering) in combination with federated search
   (combining multiple resources behind one interface). In addition, the
   user study shows that the usability of domain-specific search engines
   can successfully be evaluated using a thinking-aloud protocol with a
   small number of participants.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a quantitative picture of the interactions between
   poets in the Latin hexameter tradition. The freely available Tesserae
   website (tesserae. caset. buffalo. edu) automatically searches pairs of
   texts in a corpus of over 300 works of Latin literature in order to
   identify instances where short passages share two or more repeated
   lexemes. We use Tesserae to survey relative rates of text reuse in 24
   Latin hexameter works written from the 1st century BCE to the 6th
   century CE. We compare the quantitative information about text reuse
   provided by Tesserae to the scholarly tradition of qualitative
   discussion of allusion by Latinists.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This paper documents the results of an intensive ``data sprint{''}
   method for undertaking data and algorithmic work using application
   programming interfaces (APIs), which took place during the Digital
   Method Initiative 2013 Winter School at the University of Amsterdam.
   During this data sprint, we developed a method to map the fields of
   Digital Humanities and Electronic Literature based on title
   recommendations from the largest online bookseller, Amazon, by
   retrieving similar purchased items from the Amazon API. A first step
   shows the overall Amazon recommendation network for Digital Humanities
   and allows us to detect clusters, aligned fields and bridging books. In
   a second step we looked into four country-specific Amazon stores
   (Amazon. com, Amazon. co. uk, Amazon.fr and Amazon.de) to investigate
   the specificities of the Digital Humanities in these four countries. The
   third step is a network of all books suggested for the Electronic
   Literature field in the four Amazon stores we searched, which offers a
   comparison to the field of Digital Humanities.}},

Abstract = {{As Matthew K. Gold acknowledges in his introduction to Debates in the
   Digital Humanities, there are some gaps, some preferred object
   orientations, if you will, in the digital humanities. Many of us and our
   work fall into these gaps, cracks, and in some cases, void space. This
   work is not intended to indict the two collections examined here,
   Debates in the Digital Humanities and Companion to Digital Humanities,
   and in fact I am represented in Debates in a piece entitled, `` This
   Digital Humanities That Is Not One.{''}The piece at hand intends,
   rather, to apply a basic computational humanities method, frequency of
   keyword occurrence, to bring to the surface what is and what is not
   visible or embodied across the scope of digital humanisms.}},

Title = {{A Textual History of Mozilla: Using Topic Modeling to Trace
   Sociocultural Influences on Software Development}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This essay applies a digital humanities methodology to the study of
   digital media by framing software history as a problem of big data and
   textual criticism. While many scholars have already identified source
   code as an important site for the cultural study of software, this essay
   proposes that close reading is not suited to the scale and scope of
   modern application software. Applying text analysis tools to large
   bodies of source code can help address these problems as well as provide
   a basis for narrativizing its development and contextualization amidst a
   complex network of economic, political, and other sociocultural
   processes. Using source code produced over 15 years of development by
   the Mozilla foundation, this essay argues that software interfaces act
   as an extension of public relations narratives, often representing a
   developer's idealized version of their software which may not
   necessarily correspond with the state of the application's source code.
   Topic modeling Mozilla's source code allows us to explore a more nuanced
   narrative of development that shows how Mozilla has negotiated between
   the political ideals of open source software and the corporate ideology
   of its parent companies.}},

   Prediction}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This article describes a new method for inferring the gender of personal
   names using large historical datasets. In contrast to existing methods
   of gender prediction that treat names as if they are timelessly
   associated with one gender, this method uses a historical approach that
   takes into account how naming practices change over time. It uses
   historical data to measure the likelihood that a name was associated
   with a particular gender based on the time or place under study. This
   approach generates more accurate results for sources that encompass
   changing periods of time, providing digital humanities scholars with a
   tool to estimate the gender of names across large textual collections.
   The article first describes the methodology as implemented in the gender
   package for the R programming language. It goes on to apply the method
   to a case study in which we examine gender and gatekeeping in the
   American historical profession over the past halfcentury. The gender
   package illustrates the importance of incorporating historical
   approaches into computer science and related fields.{[}1]}},

Title = {{An Information Science Question in DH Feminism}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{2, SI}},
Abstract = {{In 1986, Susan Harding published The Science Question in Feminism in
   which she suggests that feminism had moved past questioning ``'What is
   to be done about the situation of women in science?'{''} - or first-wave
   feminist initiatives - to include more women in the work of science.
   Aspects of the ``science question{''} that consider the politics
   underlying epistemologies of ``purportedly value-neutral claims and
   practices{''} {[}Harding 1986, 23] resonate for the work (the research,
   theory, and practices) being done to build information infrastructure in
   the humanities today - the work that I am defining here as digital
   humanities work. Reconsidering this work by using the lens of feminist
   inquiry to understand the concerns common to information science and
   digital humanities is the perspective I describe here. Specifically, as
   my title suggests, I am proposing that feminist inquiry can help us
   articulate and better understand the epistemologies in digital
   humanities and information science that are shaping the infrastructures
   we are building and using in the humanities.}},

Abstract = {{A part of the special issue of DHQ on feminisms and digital humanities,
   this paper takes as its starting place Greg Crane's exhortation that
   there is a ``need to shift from lone editorials and monumental editions
   to editors... who coordinate contributions from many sources and oversee
   living editions.{''}In response to Crane, the exploration of the
   ``living edition{''} detailed here examines the process of creating a
   publicly editable edition and considers what that edition, the process
   by which it was built, and the platform in which it was produced means
   for editions that support and promote gender equity. Drawing on the
   scholarship about the culture of the Wikimedia suite of projects, and
   the gendered trolling experienced by members of our team in the
   production of the Social Edition of the Devonshire Manuscript in
   Wikibooks, and interviews with our advisory group, we argue that while
   the Wikimedia projects are often openly hostile online spaces, the
   Wikimedia suite of projects are so important to the contemporary
   circulation of knowledge, that the key is to encourage gender equity in
   social behavior, credit sharing, and knowledge organization in
   Wikimedia, rather than abandon it for a more controlled collaborative
   environment for edition production and dissemination.}},

Abstract = {{There are plenty of good reasons for building a website for your
   collection, including learning a new skill, protecting fragile resources
   from constant handling in the archives, adding interactive functionality
   that is only possible on the web, and opening access to users who cannot
   visit in person.
   But often there are better ways to share your collection. Websites are
   expensive and a lot of work. Committing to building a website is like
   committing to build and maintain a library for the foreseeable future.
   If you're reading this, you must already be enthusiastic and have a
   great idea. This flowchart is not meant to dampen that enthusiasm.
   Instead, it is written to make sure you ask yourself some of the tough
   questions too, to make sure your project is viable before you make a big
   commitment.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Abstract = {{Widespread ideals about libraries are in conflict with deep-rooted
   gender-based inequities within the library and gendered perceptions of
   libraries and librarians by the larger public. These contradictions are
   particularly striking when we look at gender in conjunction with
   information technologies that help to structure work-roles in the
   library, especially as these change. This article uses conventional and
   ``fictional{''} timelines to survey the historical junctures of gender
   and technology in the library and to speculate about the future of the
   academic library, with particular attention to deployments of the
   digital humanities in the library and its potential for disrupting these
   long-standing gender patterns.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Co-teaching a digital archives course (ENGL-GA. 2971) for graduate
   students in the English Department allowed us to bring together our
   expertise in both research and pedagogy from two fields: English
   Literature and Computer Science. The course built on a core pedagogical
   principle in Computer Science of teaching through projects rather than
   from unrelated one-off programming or web development assignments.
   Teaching the Text Encoding Initiative after students had completed
   hands-on projects (using xHTML, CSS, and a digital archive working in a
   standard content management system) enabled the building of
   technological skill sets in a logical and complementary manner. From a
   literary perspective, building a digital archive - and teaching text
   encoding - enabled an in-depth consideration of textual materiality, the
   processes through which literary scholarship must inform technological
   building decisions, and the ways in which the act of digitization can be
   used to ask new questions of the text (or to prompt the text to ask new
   questions of itself). This paper will survey our techniques and
   approaches to interdisciplinary teaching, culminating in our usage of
   text encoding for exploring issues of textuality through digital
   presentation.}},

   the counter-culture while forwarding distinctly neo-liberal ends. But
   the review also finds that Marwick has a tendency to ``study up.{''} Her

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},

Abstract = {{The article begins by asking why comics scholars should create comics as
   scholarship and traces possible answers through a variety of related
   fields: English, Rhetoric and Composition, Art, and Games. It then
   investigates the question of whether this article is itself a comic, by
   reviewing the history of the conversation about defining comics as an
   imitation of the Bayeux Tapestry. This tapestry section outlines the
   major camps, positions, and moves that comics scholars have made. The
   two major threads are the essentialist camp (with Kunzle, Eisner,
   McCloud, Harvey, Carrier, and Hayman and Pratt) and the constructivist
   camp (Meskin and Beaty). The section ends with Bart Beaty's recent
   (2012) conceptualization of a comics world that does not need to define
   individual artifacts as being or not being comics. The article ends with
   a discussion of the importance of distinguishing definition from
   conceptualization. Building on Beaty's conceptualization and Gilles
   Deleuze's theory of the concept and critique of representation, it
   offers applications to the comics world. Finally, it returns to the
   question of whether or not this article is a comic. The answer (yes, and
   becoming something else), calls for further interventions throughout the
   comics world that don't ask what comics are but what comics might
   become.}},

Title = {{Multimodal Authoring and Authority in Educational Comics: Introducing
   Derrida and Foucault for Beginners}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Abstract = {{Academic writing has generally been understood as operating primarily
   within the linguistic modality, with writing remediating the ``voice{''}
   of an educator or lecturer. Comics, by contrast, are more explicitly
   multimodal and derive much of their meaning from visual, spatial and
   linguistic modalities. Because of their multimodality, educational
   comics challenge the conception of an authoritative author's
   ``voice,{''} as is typically found in traditional educational and
   academic writing.
   To examine how authorship and authority function in multimodal
   educational texts, this paper examines several books in the popular
   ``For Beginners{''} and ``Introducing{''} series of ``graphic
   guides,{''} which use images, text, and comics to summarise the work of
   major philosophers - in this case Derrida and Foucault. The books chosen
   for this study are all collaborative efforts between writers,
   illustrators, and designers. In each book, the collaborations function
   differently, engendering different divisions of authorial labor and
   forging different constructions of multimodal relationships between
   image, text, and design.
   In order to more fully interrogate the ways that these educational
   comics combine multimodal modes of meaning, this paper itself takes the
   form of a comic, mimicking at times the books that it is examining. In
   this way, it serves as a self-reflexive critique of the idea that
   authorial voice is central to academic writing, and as an example of the
   challenges and opportunities presented by composing multimodal
   scholarship which eschews this conception of linguistic authorship.}},

Abstract = {{As discussion and debates on the digital humanities continue among

   humanities scholars and academic librarians within the Center for
   Institutional Cooperation, this study aims to explore some points of

   Qualitative interviews revealed that, while both groups are enthusiastic
   about the future of faculty-librarian collaboration on digital
   scholarship, there remain certain tensions about the role of the library
   and the librarian. Scholars appreciate the specialized expertise of
   librarians, especially in metadata and special collections, but they can
   take a more active stance in utilizing current library resources or
   vocalizing their needs for other resources. This expertise and these
   services can be leveraged to make the library an active and equal
   partner in research. Additionally, libraries should address internal
   issues, such as training and re-skilling librarians as necessary;
   better-coordinated outreach to academic departments is also needed.}},

Title = {{What can the digital humanities learn from feminist game studies?}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Abstract = {{When game studies became an area for scholarly inquiry in the academy,
   feminist game studies soon followed. The first generation of feminist
   theory in game studies built on the work of Sherry Turkle, Brenda
   Laurel, and Janet Murray, although some might argue that the legacy of
   challenging gender norms in game studies goes back even earlier. Now
   feminist game scholars organize international conferences, edit journals
   and scholarly collections, and shape trends in the profession, much as
   their counterparts in the digital humanities attempt to do, but critics
   in feminist game studies have been able to take advantage of what is
   seen as a relatively long trajectory of feminist theoretical inquiry and
   field development. Articulating a need for a feminist corrective in the
   digital humanities has come at a much slower pace, perhaps because the
   instrumentalism of a ``tool{''} seems much less blatantly anti-feminist
   than the instrumentalism of a gun. Furthermore, calls to action from
   more radicalized forms of feminist approaches to science and technology
   studies have been noticeably absent in the literature around digital
   information retrieval in the humanities. This issue of DHQ indicates
   that a sea change may finally be taking place.}},

   Crowdsourced, User-Generated Metadata}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{With the growing volume of user-generated classification systems arising
   from media tagging-based platforms (such as Flickr and Tumblr) and the
   advent of new crowdsourcing platforms for cultural heritage collections,
   determining the value and usability of crowdsourced, ``folksonomic,{''}
   or user-generated, `` freely chosen keywords{''} {[}21st Century
   Lexicon] for libraries, museums and other cultural heritage
   organizations becomes increasingly essential. The present study builds
   on prior work investigating the value and accuracy of folksonomies by:
   (1) demonstrating the benefit of user-generated ``tags{''} - or
   unregulated keywords typically meant for personal organizational
   purposes - for facilitating item retrieval and (2) assessing the
   accuracy of descriptive metadata generated via a game-based
   crowdsourcing application. In this study, participants (N = 16) were
   first tasked with finding a set of five images using a search index
   containing either a combination of folksonomic and controlled vocabulary
   metadata or only controlled vocabulary metadata. Data analysis revealed
   that participants in the folksonomic and controlled vocabulary search
   condition were, on average, six times faster to search for each image (M
   = 25.08 secs) compared to participants searching with access only to
   controlled vocabulary metadata (M = 154.1 secs), and successfully
   retrieved significantly more items overall. Following this search task,
   all participants were asked to provide descriptive metadata for nine
   digital objects by playing three separate single-player tagging games.
   Analysis showed that 88\% of participant-provided tags were judged to be
   accurate, and that both tagging patterns and accuracy levels did not
   significantly differ between groups of professional librarians and
   participants outside of the Library Science field. These findings
   illustrate the value of folksonomies for enhancing item
   ``findability,{''} or the ease with which a patron can access materials,
   and the ability of librarians and general users alike to contribute
   valid, meaningful metadata. This could significantly impact the way
   libraries and other cultural heritage organizations conceptualize the
   tasks of searching and classification.}},

   Objectification in Ezekiel 16}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Abstract = {{For nearly its entire textual life Ezekiel 16 has barely survived. Early
   Jewish communities were wary of including it in their canon of sacred
   texts because of the chapter's explicit and disturbing imagery.
   Christian communities have likewise wrestled with the text by
   essentially barring it from communal worship (the text does not appear
   in any lectionary) as well as nearly bracketing it in scholarship (most,
   if not all, scholars see the text as a violent and gross
   misrepresentation of gender roles as well as one of the most
   exacerbating cases of divine violence. Kathryn Phisterer Darr's work
   stands out as one of the few that allows the tension of the text to
   stand.). Despite all of these objections, however, the text remains in
   the canon. In this one chapter of the Book of Ezekiel, one finds themes
   of hope, love, despair, suffering, betrayal, grace, and abandonment -
   all foundational to the human experience. In addition to a colorful
   theological tapestry, one also finds a definitively historical text that
   is troubling to most contemporary readers. Theology, history, and
   contemporary reader combine to make the text and its message shocking at
   best and inaccessible at worst; this project proposes a solution by way
   of sequential art. Because the theological message of Ezekiel 16 is both
   wrapped up in the larger narratival context and presents itself through
   forceful and explicit imagery, exegeting the text via sequential art
   offers the reader a new medium for understanding the text. I propose a
   retelling of the story found in Ezekiel 16 that consciously creates
   space for the theological themes, historical realities, and contemporary
   cultural concerns all to be heard and to stand in tension with one
   another. Along with a sequential retelling of the story of Israel and
   YHWH, I will also annotate my work to provide historical, artistic and
   scholarly perspectives for the reader. I will first create the comic by
   traditional pencil and ink and then scan the images. The images can then
   appear in any form needed.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the relationship between intersectionality and the
   digital humanities. Intersectionality offers a critical approach to
   debates between theory and method in the field, transcending simplistic
   hack vs. yack binaries. This article situates debates over difference in
   the digital humanities within the context of the culture wars within the
   U.S. academy during the 1980s and 1990s, locating the stakes for
   diversity in the digital humanities. It surveys digital humanities
   projects, outlining the need for alternate histories of the digital
   humanities told through intersectional lenses. Finally, the article
   proposes ways of looking forward towards the deeper intersectional
   analysis needed to expand intellectual diversity in the field and move
   difference beyond the margins of the digital humanities.}},

Title = {{Humanities Unbound: Supporting Careers and Scholarship Beyond the Tenure
   Track}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{As humanities scholars increasingly recognize the value of public
   engagement, and as the proportion of tenure-track faculty positions
   available to new graduates continues to decline, many humanities
   programs are focusing renewed attention on equipping graduate students
   for careers as scholars both within and beyond academe. To support those
   efforts, the Scholarly Communication Institute has carried out a study
   investigating perceptions about career preparation provided by
   humanities graduate programs. The survey results help to create a more
   solid foundation on which to base curricular reform and new initiatives
   by moving the conversation about varied career paths from anecdote to
   data. The findings make it clear that there are a number of effective
   interventions that programs can undertake. Many of the skills that
   people working beyond the tenure track identify as crucial to their
   positions - things like project management, collaboration, and
   communication - are also highly beneficial to those working within the
   professoriate. Structuring courses and projects in a way that emphasizes
   the acquisition of these skills not only contributes to the success of
   students who pursue employment outside the tenure track, but also to the
   vibrant research, teaching, and service of those who pursue academic
   roles. With the availability of new data to work from and the
   recommendations above as possible guiding principles, graduate programs
   have a robust set of tools available that can help facilitate curricular
   assessment and new initiatives. As the importance of assessing the
   effectiveness of existing structures and considering potential benefits
   of reform continues to grow, humanities programs have a strong incentive
   to demonstrate the ways that their graduate programs contribute to the
   vitality of the university and the broader public sphere. Equipping
   graduate students with the skills and literacies needed for 21st century
   scholarly work - from technical fluency to an understanding of
   organizational structures - is critical to ensuring continued rigorous
   and creative research, scholarship, and teaching.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},

Abstract = {{This review of Jessica Pressman's Digital Modernism: Making It New in
   New Media (2014) emphasizes the field-building significance of
   Pressman's innovative approach to analyzing electronic literature, an
   approach that reinvigorates the dated methods of New Criticism for use
   in the digital humanities. Pressman identifies a genre of contemporary
   electronic literature, ``digital modernism,{''} and uncovers
   continuities linking it with early twentieth-century modernism. In spite
   of an uneven style that oscillates between belabored scholasticism and
   brilliant description, Digital Modernism rigorously wrangles a wide
   array of data points - historical, literary, and technological - to
   create an account of contemporary electronic literature relevant for
   digital humanists, literary scholars, and New Media scholars. This
   review contextualizes the work within new currents in modernist
   scholarship, reflects on the modernism and digital modernist ``canon{''}
   Pressman assembles, and then provides chapter summaries, with an
   emphasis on Digital Modernism's reinvention of close reading for the
   twenty-first century.}},

Abstract = {{Although Digital Humanities (DH) has become more established in recent
   years one of the main issues that remains is the true
   internationalization of DH as an academic discipline. Up to this point
   the DH community has been mainly focused on scholars from a handful of
   English speaking countries and there is little or no participation from
   other regions of the world. This paper discusses the experience of
   setting up a DH community in Mexico. The aim is to describe the
   multi-faceted approach used for DH community building as well as
   discussing different strategies employed, difficulties encountered,
   produced results as well as areas for future growth. We propose that
   this may serve as a model for similar initiatives in other countries.}},

Abstract = {{We present ``archival liveness{''} as a concept in design and the
   Digital Humanities and describe its development within a Research
   Through Design process. Working with a newly acquired archive of
   contemporary poetry we produced designs that both manifested and
   ``geared in to{''} {[}Durrant 2011] {[}Gurwitsch 1979] the temporal
   rhythms of the work and infrastructure of archiving. Drawing on
   user-centred work with participants, often poets themselves, we focused
   on marginalia as a material feature of the archive, developing a drawing
   machine and live Twitter bot. Our work addresses institutional concerns
   for outreach and engagement while also acknowledging and exploiting the
   inevitably incomplete or live character of archival collections. For
   designers working with digital archives, we demonstrate the pragmatic
   and critical value of liveness as a focus of the design process.}},

   Ecosystem}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Abstract = {{As the diversity of digital humanities practitioners grows, the need to
   construct a framework allowing for equal acknowledgement to all involved
   has become more evident. In this article, I argue that the perceived
   immateriality of scholarship privileges conventional academic labor over
   similar pursuits, such as data curation, resulting in them being glanced
   over and ignored in tenure reviews and job evaluations. To counter this,
   I create a theoretical framework that places materiality at the
   forefront. More specifically, I draw on and expand Gilles Deleuze's
   notion of assemblages, as outlined by new materialist philosopher Manuel
   DeLanda, to posit the idea of ``data assemblages,{''} which are the
   result of digital humanities labor and consist of material parts
   contingent on their contextual relations and always in flux. I use the
   Digital Public Library as a case study and highlight how the
   reconceptualization of digital humanities labor moves beyond the merely
   theoretical to allow us to better understand the interdependency of
   individuals in the academic ecosystem and has broader implications for
   the nature of materiality in the digital age.}},

Title = {{Sequential Rhetoric: Using Freire and Quintilian to Teach Students to
   Read and Create Comics}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Abstract = {{Our comic combines visual literacy, progymnasmata, and critical pedagogy
   to showcase a classroom study that used comics production to teach
   visual literacy. The comic first looks at comics criticism, visual
   rhetoric, and comics scholarship to set a base to build a methodology
   build in critical pedagogy and ancient rhetoric. Critical pedagogy's
   tradition of inviting students to find meaning in the origin of ideas
   fits in with having students design and study a medium that's often
   overlooked during their college experience. Such an approach echoes
   Freire's ideas of using critical strategies as an effective model for
   change. Progymnasmata, and Quintilian's work in general, allows students
   to approach the new medium of comics through reading and production
   through an ancient rhetorical practice that relies on a step-by-step
   process. Looking at Quintilian's pedagogy, we demonstrate a modern
   classroom study that uses progymnasmata to make the strange familiar
   while introducing visuality. The actual study is briefly discussed as
   well. This amalgamation of ancient rhetoric, comics studies, and
   critical pedagogy is the basis of the research behind this pieces' goal
   of exploring comics as a multimodal means of composition.}},

Abstract = {{Decades of digitisation have made a wealth of digital cultural material
   available online. Yet search - the dominant interface to these

   argues for a more generous alternative: rich, browsable interfaces that
   reveal the scale and complexity of digital heritage collections. Drawing
   on related work and precedents from information retrieval and
   visualisation, as well as critical humanistic approaches to the
   interface, this paper documents and analyses practical experiments in
   generous interfaces developed in collaboration with Australian cultural

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Textual bricolage, the unacknowledged re-use of chunks of existing texts
   within a new composition, spans the liminal space between authorized,
   publicly shared, and de-authorized texts. While it can result in unique
   literary juxtapositions, bricolage also challenges the boundaries of
   authorial ownership. Understanding the methods and responses to textual
   bricolage reflects how a culture engages with textuality. Yet such study
   is often hindered by the sheer extent of compared texts. In this article
   we explore the potential of using Factotum, text similarity recognition
   software with visual interface, for analysing textual bricolage. Using
   examples from medieval and recent texts, we discuss different
   compilation techniques as well as the interaction between the notions of
   authorship, plagiarism and intertextuality.}},

Title = {{Xpos're: A Tool for Rich Internet Publications}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Internet technologies are gradually reshaping the function of
   traditional scholarly publications. There is a growing tendency in some
   disciplines to publish a digital paper together with supplements such as
   images, videos, 3D-models and underlying data. More information requires
   a better usability in terms of overview and finding information, which
   has led to new features in journals and thus to modifying and extending
   this genre. These so-called enhanced publications or rich internet
   publications have various physical forms: PDF documents with embedded
   interactive models, HTML files enriched with hyperlinks to contextual
   information and with facilities to highlight information in the text, or
   aggregations of documents and other resources linked together through
   metadata which make them findable for semantic search engines.
   However, many of the originally print-based journals, particularly in
   the humanities and social sciences, are still rather conservative in
   format and offer hardly any opportunities for enhanced publishing, which
   leaves room for some form of self-publishing, perhaps as addition to a
   regular journal article. In this paper we introduce the Xpos're tools
   for authoring and displaying an interactive multimedia scholarly
   publication, which may be created as a digital companion to a regular
   journal paper and published, for example, on the author or institution's
   website in order to share related research products and to achieve
   greater visibility. We also report about practical experiences with this
   software in a few research projects.
   The Xpos're software (see: http://xposre.nl/software/) comprises a
   Flash-based document reader and a set of extensions (plug-ins) that
   extend the basic functionality of this text browser. The extensions are
   used to display specific types of multimedia that provide additional
   functionality, such as viewing images, videos and interactive maps. The
   input text is XML based, which not only guarantees a durable and
   flexible encoding of content, but also allows automatic rendering in
   different formats according to the preferences of users and the
   limitations of their hardware. In addition, the XML source can be easily
   transformed to an RDF resource map to meet the requirements of the
   semantic web. The document reader generates output in HTML, in two
   flavors, namely a slide based version that uses JavaScript, and a plain
   HTML text (single page), which is most suitable for printing and which
   can be used to create e-books. This plain HTML text can also be
   displayed in a format similar to that of scientific journals through the
   Xpos're HTML Reader, which has more features than the automatically
   generated slides and which can be highly customized by the user.}},

Title = {{Escaping the Shallows: Deep Reading's Revival in the Digital Age}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Among the many reactions against the digital revolution is a
   humanitarian movement toward long form online reading in collective and
   social networks. This movement - visible in online book clubs such as
   ``Infinite Summer{''} and 1book140, websites such as longreads. com, and
   the trend of blogs-to-books publication - is a reaction against
   superficial increasingly brief headline-driven Internet news. Called to
   action by the threat of what critic Jessica Helfand has diagnosed as
   digital culture's ``narrative depravation,{''} the deep reading revival
   has reclaimed narrative and returned it to the populace, transforming
   reading into an act of mass collaboration on an unprecedented scale.
   Despite studies corroborating Nicholas Carr's claim in The Shallows
   (2011) that the distractions of the digital environment are anathema to
   immersive linear deep reading, online culture has actually enhanced and
   accelerated the appreciation of longer richer works through its support
   of ``radial reading{''} as described by Jerome McGann. This essay argues
   that while the intrinsically distracting virtual geography of the
   Internet has threatened to diminish the role of textured narrative in
   our intellectual and social lives, the Web has ironically provided the
   media for the most salient movements in support of the deep reading it
   threatens to obliterate.}},

Abstract = {{This essay discusses agent-based modeling (ABM) and its potential as a
   technique for studying history, including literary history. How can a
   computer simulation tell us anything about the past? This essay has
   three distinct goals. The first is simply to introduce agent-based
   modeling as a computational practice to an audience of digital
   humanists, for whom it remains largely unfamiliar despite signs of
   increasing interest. Second, to introduce one possible application for
   social simulation by comparing it to conventional, print-based models of
   the history of book publishing. Third, and most importantly, I'll sketch
   out a theory and preliminary method for incorporating social simulation
   into an on-going program of humanities research.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Exhibits focusing specifically on Electronic Literature have been
   mounted at galleries, libraries, universities, convention spaces, and
   parks and other outside venues. The Electronic Literature Organization's
   2012 Media Art Show, for example, hosted exhibits in five different
   locations in Morgantown, including a community arts center, local
   gallery, the university library, a department's conference room, and the
   city's amphitheater, while the MLA 2012 and 2013 exhibits were held at
   the Washington State and Hynes convention centers, respectively. The
   Library of Congress, the most important repository of books in the U.S.,
   hosted Electronic Literature \& Its Emerging Forms in April 2013 while
   Illuminations gallery at University of Ireland Maymooth featured an
   exhibit of electronic literature in March 2014. This range of venues
   suggests a flexibility and appeal of electronic literature that is both
   scalable and broad. With these qualities in mind, this article outlines
   the various exhibits of electronic literature that the author has
   curated in order to highlight the two main challenges facing all
   scholars curating digital - that is, the challenge of availability and
   the challenge of presentation.}},

Title = {{Adobe Photoshop and Eighteenth-Century Manuscripts: A New Approach to
   Digital Paleography}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{While research coordinator at the Burney Centre at McGill University in
   Montreal, I pioneered new digital paleographical methods to support the
   editorial work on Frances Burney and Samuel Richardson undertaken there.
   Prior to my interventions, the primary method for reading faint,
   obscured, and obliterated manuscript texts had been multi-spectral
   imaging, which is prohibitively expensive, limiting its utility as a
   general research tool, although it is still sometimes in use. There have
   not been many alternative digital paleographical methodologies. The
   potential of image manipulation software, such as Adobe Photoshop, has
   been noted by a few scholars, but not explored. Working in Adobe
   Photoshop, I have developed a method of deciphering heavily deleted or
   obliterated text through the use of layering techniques, altered color
   levels, and the employment of certain kinds of filters. The method is
   more advanced than simple image enlargement techniques used by most
   researchers. Importantly though, it remains far less expensive than
   multispectral imaging. The technique contributed to the recovery of
   nearly all of the obliterated text in the first two volumes of The Court
   Journals and Letters of Frances Burney, which were published by Oxford
   University Press in 2011, and it was also used within in-progress
   volumes from The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Samuel Richardson.
   This article discusses the methodology and some of its key results from
   eighteenth-century manuscripts.}},

Abstract = {{``Before You Read{''} is a review essay of Katherine Bode's Reading by

   uncovered in the current historical record of Australian authorship and
   publishing. From nationalistic assumptions, to gender trends, to the
   relationship between colonizer and colonized, Bode systematically
   challenges the existing scholarly narrative. Additionally, the book
   offers a unique case study of qualitative methods in literary study,
   demonstrating the value of ``reading{''} the numbers behind a
   comprehensive corpus, versus elevating selected canonical pieces as

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{This paper is situated within debates surrounding modes of ``close{''}
   and ``distant reading{''} {[}Moretti 2000] as they are played out in
   both the fields of world literature and digital literary studies. It
   proposes an alternative digital humanities approach to the study of
   world literature, advocating new methods of close comparative reading
   rather than the mode of ``distant reading{''} endorsed by Franco Moretti
   and Alan Liu {[}Liu 2012]. Specifically, the research method proposed
   here is focused on a close reading of the novel The Secret Scripture
   (2008) by Irish author Sebastian Barry, with comparative reference to
   Pat Barker's well-known war novel Regeneration (1997). Through the
   development and implementation of a digital humanities research method
   which facilitates new forms of digital literary analysis, we demonstrate
   that close reading and digital humanities can too be ``practicing
   partners{''} in a way that serves to advance work in both the fields of
   world literature and digital literary studies.}},

Abstract = {{Of all narrative textual forms, the motion picture screenplay may be the
   most perfectly predisposed for computational analysis. Screenplays
   contain capitalized character names, indented dialogue, and other
   formatting conventions that enable an algorithmic approach to analyzing
   and visualizing film narratives. In this article, the authors introduce
   their new tool, ScripThreads, which parses screenplays, outputs
   statistical values which can be analyzed, and offers four different
   types of visualization, each with its own utility. The visualizations
   represent character interactions across time as a single 3D or 2D graph.
   The authors model the utility of the tool for the close analysis of a
   single film (Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon {[}1991]). They also model
   how the tool can be used for ``distant reading{''} by identifying
   patterns of character presence across a dataset of 674 screenplays.}},

   awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2003, there is a strong but

   recent renaissance of computer-assisted statistical approaches to
   literary analysis, the present article charts in detail a formative

   adopted, then deconstructed, and eventually rejected one of the

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Systems of canonical references, whereby segments of written works are
   sequentially labeled with numbers or letters to facilitate
   cross-referencing, are widely used but seldom studied, undeservedly so.
   Canonical numbers are complex interpretive mechanisms with a great deal
   of potential for anyone editing and using electronic texts. In this
   essay I consider the rationale for and nature of canonical reference
   systems, to recommend principles to consider when deploying them in
   digital projects. After briefly reviewing the history of canonical
   references I note how they have been used so far, emphasizing the
   advances made by Canonical Text Services (CTS). I argue that the
   practical and theoretical problems that remain unaddressed require
   engagement with descriptions of how textual scholarship works and how
   notional literary works relate to the artefacts that carry them (using
   Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records, FRBR). By correlating
   a theory of canonical reference numbers with those two models -
   editorial workflow and creative works - I offer key principles that
   should be addressed when planning, writing, and using digital projects.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{The digital era has become inundated with the idea of anonymity as on
   the Internet where users create avatars in forums and write without
   obvious material constraint; however when considering documents such as
   graphic novels and print fiction, the figure of the author remains a
   nostalgic figure which grants validity to the document. In classic comic
   book collections such as Watchmen and Batman: Year One by Alan Moore and
   Frank Miller, the original scripts by the authors are included in
   special editions in both print and Kindle format. But these
   ``original{''} script pages are shrouded in forms of anonymity as they
   illustrate signs of digitization, either through scanning or during
   production and thus display various visual clues, such as errors, which
   relay levels of realness. Furthermore online versions of these script
   pages, found on fan website databases and authors' blogs, are
   complicated by the anonymity the Internet and digital editions produce.
   Therefore a digital forensics methodology is used to interrogate these
   script pages in both print and digital format to create an ordering
   system for digitally manipulated text. It also endeavours to illustrate
   the possibilities for a forming digital forensics field by using various
   technical calculations and recreations of text with original software
   and hardware.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},

Abstract = {{For digital humanists planning to build tools for cyberinfrastructure
   several variables ought to be defined for each project. Pay close
   attention to the balance of traditional methods and new ways of
   conducting research. When gathering resources to do the job, seek
   contributions of different domain experts. Also, careful consideration
   of a tool's intended scope will help refine the required resources
   needed to complete a project. This case study illustrates how one
   project, the Social Networks and Archival Context Project (SNAC), has
   defined these variables. The process of building a new tool also
   benefits from an awareness of older infrastructure that has come before
   it. SNAC illustrates this awareness in the way it has taken advantage of
   previously existing infrastructure, both cyber and not, by extending its
   purpose and building new features on top of it.}},

   Safran Foer's Tree of Codes, this article confronts the difficulty of

   this decidedly paper bound text. The result of this experiment produced
   a digitized version of Tree of Codes that allows for a further
   discussion of issues of loss, deformation, and versioning alongside a
   wider conversation on presentation semantics on the web and browser

Abstract = {{Well-designed digital tools facilitate the creation of new knowledge in
   the humanities. Good design is user-centered, focused, and needs-driven,
   all of which depend on a rich understanding of the target audience or
   end user. Unsworth's scholarly primitives {[}Unsworth 2000] and the work
   of Palmer, Teffeau and Pirmann {[}Palmer et al. 2009] on scholarly
   information practices provide a framework for understanding how
   humanities scholars do their work. We propose applying this framework to
   the design of a spoken word archive, with the aim of designing a digital
   tool that is optimized for the documented practices of scholars. We
   propose that listening and annotation are key activities of humanities
   scholars performing literary criticism of audio recordings. Taking the
   SpokenWeb poetry project as an example, we discuss how designing a
   web-based tool with these key activities in mind could facilitate close
   and critical engagement with recordings of spoken poetry. We present a
   methodology for designing a web-based sound archive for literary
   criticism and we propose features and functionalities that facilitate
   this criticism.}},

Abstract = {{With the digitization of the parliamentary proceedings (Handelingen der
   Staten Generaal), the structuring of this body of data, and the
   development of an advanced search engine, we can apply new methods of
   historical research. This contributes to a further promotion of the
   sophisticated use of quantitative data to enhance qualitative historical
   research. This article focuses on the Boerenpartij(Farmers' Party), the
   first political party from the far right that entered Dutch parliament
   after the Second World War (WWII). The Boerenpartij is remembered as
   being stigmatized by the traditional political parties as ``wrong{''}
   ({''}fout{''}), as National Socialism and its supporters were dubbed in
   the Netherlands. However, no systematic research has been conducted on
   the questions: in what way, how frequently and for what purpose these
   connections with the ``wrong{''} past were made. With the available
   digitized data and the retrieval techniques offered by computer
   scientists it is now possible to answer these questions.}},

Title = {{Managing an Established Digital Humanities Project: Principles and
   Practices from the Twentieth Year of the William Blake Archive}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Scholars and practitioners of the digital humanities generally recognize
   the importance of solid project management and oversight. But coursework
   and publications related to DH project management tend to focus heavily
   on the difficulties of planning and launching a new project rather than
   the challenges of maintaining an established one. Meanwhile, online
   advice for wouldbe managers is couched in the language of ``tips and
   tricks{''} or ``steps for beginners{''}. Together these phenomena
   downplay the professional skills needed to successfully manage a project
   while suggesting that project management is necessary only in the
   beginning stages of an endeavor. They may even give the impression that
   scholarship in the digital humanities is inherently ephemeral. Through a
   case study of project management practices at the William Blake Archive,
   which began publishing electronic scholarly editions in 1996, this essay
   details the challenges and rewards of managing an established digital
   humanities project. Managers of mature projects may be called upon to
   oversee expansions in scope and mission, research and recommend new
   features and tools, grow or shrink the number of project staff, seek out
   alternate sources of support when early grants run out, maintain
   continuity as collaborators join and leave the project, and develop new
   workflows and procedures to reflect these and other changes.}},

Abstract = {{In the digital humanities we specialize in imagining and launching

   we propose to discuss the ends of a particular digital project as a case

   Globalization and Autonomy Online Compendium that was developed as a
   digital outcome of the Globalization and Autonomy project. Specifically,
   this paper will:
   1. Survey the general issues at stake when planning for the end of a
   digital project;
   2. Provide some background on the project and the Compendium;
   3. Discuss the underlying technologies that had to be dealt with;
   4. Address the specific problem of ending and how we prepared this
   project for archival deposit;
   5. And conclude by talking about some other ends that are really

   and to the variety of digital-humanistic methods that comprise Moretti's
   quantitative formalism. Most valuable as an artifact of
   literary-critical history rather than a how-to guide or theoretical
   treatise, this hodgepodge of essays is at its best as an audacious and
   defensive academic memoir tracing Moretti's transformation into a
   digital humanist. As Moretti champions the broad explanatory power of
   quantitative literary analysis, he overestimates the scientific
   objectivity of his analyses while undervaluing the productively
   suggestive stories of doubt, failure, and compromise that lend nuance
   and depth to his hypotheses. Combative, absorbing, highly topical, and
   unevenly persuasive, Distant Reading embodies both the optimism of early
   digital literary studies and its perils.}},

Abstract = {{This article articulates a view of the digital humanities that hopes to
   advance the discipline across broad scholarly and administrative
   contexts. It will succeed in its aims if it is both comprehensible to
   newcomers and stimulating for experienced practitioners: a
   ``bridging{''} effort, but one undertaken with serious intent. It
   proceeds by isolating a key debate for examination, describing two
   concepts that go a significant distance to solving issues raised by that
   debate (but not far enough), and exploring the theoretical writings of a
   selection of high profile digital humanists. The goal (a nontrivial
   undertaking) is to illustrate the utility of postfoundationalism as a
   conceptual tool, its interdependence with postindustrial culture, and
   the light it sheds on our understanding of what ``DH{''} is. If
   successful the article, rather than making an essentialist claim that
   ``Digital Humanities is defined by postfoundational method,{''} will
   constitute a contribution to the developing digital humanities
   ``agenda.{''}}},

Abstract = {{Digital humanities research that requires the digitization of
   medium-scale, project-specific texts confronts a significant
   methodological and practical question: is labour-intensive cleaning of
   the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output necessary to produce
   robust results through text mining analysis? This paper traces the steps
   taken in a collaborative research project that aimed to analyze
   newspaper coverage of a high-profile murder trial, which occurred in New
   York City in 1873. A corpus of approximately one-half million words was
   produced by converting original print sources and image files into
   digital texts, which produced a substantial rate of OCR-generated
   errors. We then corrected the scans and added document-level genre
   metadata. This allowed us to evaluate the impact of our quality upgrade
   procedures when we tested for possible differences in word usage across
   two key phases in the trial's coverage using log likelihood ratio
   {[}Dunning 1993]. The same tests were run on each dataset - the original
   OCR scans, a subset of OCR scans selected through the addition of genre
   metadata, and the metadata-enhanced scans corrected to 98\% accuracy.
   Our results revealed that error correction is desirable but not
   essential. However, metadata to distinguish between different genres of
   trial coverage, obtained during the correction process, had a
   substantial impact. This was true both when investigating all words and
   when testing for a subset of ``judgment words{''} we created to explore
   the murder's emotive elements and its moral implications. Deeper
   analysis of this case, and others like it, will require more
   sophisticated text mining techniques to disambiguate word sense and
   context, which may be more sensitive to OCR-induced errors.}},

Abstract = {{For Vilem Flusser, philosopher of technology, the advent of photography
   heralded the return of the image from its subjection to the linearity of
   written language. Here we extend his concept of the ``techno-image{''}
   (successor of the pre-historical hand-drawn image and the historical
   printed word), to consider the digital image-text that today dominates
   reading and writing. Our question: Can we reader-writers think the
   digitas, or are we doomed to perform its functions in an
   ``automati{[}c]{''} or ``robotiz{[}ed]{''} fashion, as Flusser put it,
   so that, if anything, the digitas now ``thinks{''} us? The short answer
   to our question is as follows: we can think the digitas, but only if we
   consider it, firstly, as a kind of writing ({''}digital orthography{''})
   and, secondly, as a caricature of thinking, both impoverished and, dare
   we say it, funny ({''}digital caricature{''}).}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzes popular songs composed by Japanese female
   singer-songwriters. Popular songs are a good representation of modern
   culture and society. Songs by female singer-songwriters account for a
   large portion of the current Japanese hit charts and particularly play
   an important role in understanding the Japanese language and
   communication style. In this study, we applied new methods of
   computational stylistics to the lyrics of the songs. The results clearly
   show differences in the characteristics of 10 female singer-
   songwriters, and we found that the ``visualization of the lyrics{''} is
   a typical characteristic of current singer-songwriters. Our findings
   provide an important case study for computational stylistics and can
   also be useful for understanding Japanese cultural trends.}},

Title = {{Modeling Afro-Latin American Artistic Representations in Topic Maps:
   Cuba's Prominence in Latin American Discourse}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Abstract = {{Artistic representations of African-descendant cultures in Latin
   America, the Hispanic Caribbean, and the Hispanic World have emerged as
   the outcome of multiple exchanges, inventions, and cultural
   coexistences. Such representations take part of a network where
   cultural, ethnic, social, artistic, literary, and racial information
   circulates, giving shape to centers with multiple connections at
   different scales. In accordance with this, the main aim of this article
   is to demonstrate how Cuba's predominance for the representation of such
   cultural pattern is not only based on the significance of particular
   artistic figures, but also on the connectivity that the island as a
   cultural node has with respect to the `global' network of African and
   African-descendant representations. In order to achieve this aim, we
   carry out two main tasks: a) network analysis looking at related
   concepts such as centrality, connectivity, betweenness, modularity,
   etc., through a methodology that takes into account topic-map analysis
   and the use of Page Ranking Algorithm {[}the algorithm used by good part
   of search engines such as Google] as the basic formula to filter and
   organize information; b) local analysis of two nodes that take part of
   Cuba's cluster in order to compare the results of the analysis of
   networks with a more socio-literary analysis that focuses on detailed
   reading of some of their messages (works, paratexts, prologues,
   interviews, etc): Nicolas Guillen and Alejo Carpentier. As matter of
   conclusions, we evaluate not only our findings with regards to Cuba but
   also the methodology as a contribution to the field of the Digital
   humanities and its practices of analysis.}},

Number = {{1, SI}},
Abstract = {{What does the category of the literary give to digital humanities?
   Nothing and everything. This essay considers the ``idiocy{''} of the
   literary: its unaccountable singularity, which guarantees that we
   continue to return to it as a source, inspiration, and challenge. As a
   consequence, digital humanities is inspired and irritated by the
   literary.
   My essay shows this in three ways. First, through a speculative
   exploration of the relation between digital humanities and the category
   of ``the literary.{''} Second, through a quick survey of the use of
   literature in digital humanities project. Thirdly, through a specific
   examination of TEI and character rendering as digital humanities
   concerns that necessarily engage with the literary. Once again, the
   literary remains singular and not abstract, literal in a way that
   challenges and provokes us towards new digital humanities work.}},

Title = {{Sounding for Meaning: Using Theories of Knowledge Representation to
   Analyze Aural Patterns in Texts}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Abstract = {{Computational literary analytics that include frequency trends and
   collocation, topic modeling, and network analysis have relied on rapid
   and large-scale analysis of the word or strings of words. This essay
   shows that there are many other features of literary texts by which
   humanists make meaning other than the word, such as prosody and sound,
   and how computational methods allow us to do what has historically been
   a more difficult method of analysis - trying to understand how literary
   texts make meaning with these features. This paper will discuss a case
   study that uses theories of knowledge representation and research on
   phonetic and prosodic symbolism to develop analytics and visualizations
   that help readers discover aural and prosodic patterns in literary
   texts. To this end, this paper has two parts: (I) We describe the
   theories of knowledge representation and research into phonetic and
   prosodic symbolism that underpin the logics and ontologies of aurality
   incorporated in our project. This basic theory of aurality is reflected
   in our use of OpenMary, a text-to-speech application tool for extracting
   aural features; in the ``flow{''} we coordinated to pre-process texts in
   SEASR's Meandre, a data flow environment; in the instance-based
   predictive modeling procedure that we developed for the project; and in
   ProseVis, the reader interface that we created to allow readers to
   discover aural features across literary texts. And (II), we discuss
   readings of several works by Gertrude Stein (the portraits ``Matisse{''}
   and ``Picasso{''} and the prose poem Tender Buttons) that were
   facilitated by this work.}},

   Hawthorne's ``Celestial Railroad{''} in the Antebellum Religious Press}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{In this article, Cordell demonstrates the transformative possibilities
   of large-scale digital archives for literary history and bibliography.
   Focusing on the recently-uncovered reprinting history of Nathaniel
   Hawthorne's short story, ``The Celestial Railroad{''}, in the
   nineteenth-century press, the article demonstrates the central, shaping
   influence of religious readers and editors on Hawthorne's early career.
   Cordell shows how the best traditional bibliography of Hawthorne's works
   could be dramatically altered after only a few weeks' work in digital
   archives of newspapers, magazines, and books, and using relatively
   simple search tools. Such tools not only expanded the number of known
   witnesses of the text, but also uncovered numerous paratexts:
   introductions to the story, articles reviewing or referring to the
   story, sermons derived from the story, etc. This ``social text{''} of
   ``The Celestial Railroad,{''} Cordell argues, lay buried amidst millions
   of pages that accumulated in the nineteenth century and required modern
   tools to be uncovered. The article also discusses how digital
   interpretive tools can help make better sense of such enlarged
   bibliographies. By comparing multiple printings of `` The Celestial
   Railroad{''} using the Juxta Collation tool from NINES, Cordell argues
   that textual fluidity can tell modern readers much about how texts were
   understood by their original publishers and readers. The many changes to
   and discussions of `` The Celestial Railroad,{''} for instance, indicate
   that the tale was popular for its perceived anti-denominational message,
   but nonetheless deployed as a weapon in denominational debates.}},

Abstract = {{Within the digital humanities, there are many approaches to citation.
   Every discipline handles citation and authorship differently, and within
   the digital humanities there are wide divergences of practice in the
   ways that credit is assigned and made visible. However, there is also
   broad agreement that citation practices need scrutiny and perhaps
   rethinking. The issue arises with particular force when we consider how
   to cite digital humanities projects and tools. Standard citation
   practices do not provide good precedents for making visible the
   contributions of project personnel in these highly collaborative
   efforts. There has been significant informal discussion and debate in
   recent years concerning appropriate ways to credit this work, but no
   consensus has been reached. FairCite(http://faircite.wordpress.com) was
   founded to promote this discussion and encourage it towards practical,
   public outcomes.}},

Title = {{Performative Materiality and Theoretical Approaches to Interface}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Abstract = {{This article outlines a critical framework for a theory of performative
   materiality and its potential application to interface design from a
   humanistic perspective. Discussions of the materiality of digital media
   have become richer and more complex in the last decade, calling the
   literal, physical, and networked qualities of digital artifacts and
   systems to attention. This article extends those discussions by
   reconnecting them to a longer history of investigations of materiality
   and the specificity of media in critical theory and aesthetics. In
   addition, it introduces the concept of performative materiality, the
   enacted and event-based character of digital activity supported by those
   literal, physical conditions, and introduces the theoretical concerns
   that attach to that rubric. Performative materiality is based on the
   conviction that a system should be understood by what it does, not only
   how it is structured. As digital humanities matures, it can benefit from
   a re-engagement with the mainstream principles of critical theory on
   which a model of performative materiality is based. The article takes
   these ideas into a more focused look at how we might move towards
   integrating this model and critical principles into a model of
   humanistic interface design.}},

Title = {{Revenge of the Nerd: Junot Diaz and the Networks of American Literary
   Imagination}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Abstract = {{Junot Diaz's writing actively questions the boundaries between genre and
   ``literary{''} fiction, aesthetics and politics, and English and
   Spanish, using a framework of multiple linguistic, formal and cultural
   registers to establish an authorial presence that defies critical
   categorization. Diaz arrived explosively on the U.S. literary scene with
   his second book, the novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. The
   multi-generational story of a Dominican American family overshadowed by
   a brutal dictatorship and the challenges of forging a new life in the
   United States earned many accolades, including the Pulitzer Prize for
   Fiction and the National Book Critics Circle Award. I read Diaz's
   transgressive blending of genre and linguistic registers as a ``reverse
   colonization{''} that calls into question the demarcations of American
   ethnicity as well as the racial politics of nerds. My argument uses Diaz
   as both an object of study and a paradigm for the potential of a hybrid
   digital humanities methodology. The complex cultural translation that
   Diaz asks his readers to perform creates a middle ground where Caribbean
   history, language politics and the class and ethnic tensions of
   immigration collide with the nerdy core of the mainstream American
   imagination.}},

Title = {{The End of Literature: Machine Reading and Amitav Ghosh's The Calcutta
   Chromosome}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Abstract = {{Digital humanities discussions of distant reading, machine reading or
   not-reading have often turned on a depiction of the field of literary
   production in which individual texts and authors recede in importance as
   units of analysis. At the same time, the question of what is specific to
   the literary in discussions of electronic textuality, or the digital
   literary, has been under-analyzed. This article contributes to
   theorizing the digital literary by way of an analysis (or close reading)
   of the role of machine reading in a postcolonial science fiction novel
   by Amitav Ghosh, The Calcutta Chromosome. This novel participates in the
   imagination of electronic textuality and digital forensics at a moment
   when the imagined possibilities of the digital archive were of intense
   interest to both cultural critics and literary writers. The figure of
   the writer of vernacular literature in the novel, I argue, brings
   together the text's interest in both electronic textuality and the
   subaltern archive, thus establishing the stakes of the digital precisely
   on a revamped role for the literary in the context of globalization. As
   such, Ghosh's novel provides a useful opportunity for re-considering
   proposals for distant reading in relation to world literary studies and
   postcolonial criticism.}},

Title = {{The. txtual Condition: Digital Humanities, Born-Digital Archives, and
   the Future Literary}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Abstract = {{In 1995 in the midst of the first widespread wave of digitization, the
   Modern Language Association issued a Statement on the Significance of
   Primary Records in order to assert the importance of retaining books and
   other physical artifacts even after they have been microfilmed or
   scanned for general consumption. ``A primary record,{''} the MLA told us
   then, ``can appropriately be defined as a physical object produced or
   used at the particular past time that one is concerned with in a given
   instance{''} (27). Today, the conceit of a ``primary record{''} can no
   longer be assumed to be coterminous with that of a ``physical
   object.{''} Electronic texts, files, feeds, and transmissions of all
   sorts are also now, indisputably, primary records. In the specific
   domain of the literary, a writer working today will not and cannot be
   studied in the future in the same way as writers of the past, because
   the basic material evidence of their authorial activity - manuscripts
   and drafts, working notes, correspondence, journals - is, like all
   textual production, increasingly migrating to the electronic realm. This
   essay therefore seeks to locate and triangulate the emergence of a.
   txtual condition - I am of course remediating Jerome McGann's
   influential notion of a ``textual condition{''} - amid our contemporary
   constructions of the ``literary{''}, along with the changing nature of
   literary archives, and lastly activities in the digital humanities as
   that enterprise is now construed. In particular, I will use the example
   of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the
   University of Maryland as a means of illustrating the kinds of resources
   and expertise a working digital humanities center can bring to the table
   when confronted with the range of materials that archives and manuscript
   repositories will increasingly be receiving.}},

   Ekphrasis}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Abstract = {{In this article, the significance of the rhetorical and modern
   definitions of ekphrasis will be discussed through the lens of digital
   literature and art. It attempts to reinscribe the body in ekphrastic
   practice by adding touch to the abstracted visualism of the eye, and
   emphasize defining features of the ancient usage: orality, immediacy and
   tactility. What I call the digital ekphrasis with its emphasis on
   enargeia, its strong connections with the ancient definition, and on the
   bodily interaction with the work of art, conveys an aesthetic of
   tactility; digitalis=finger. By tracing and elucidating a historical
   trajectory that takes the concept of ekphrasis in the ancient culture as
   a starting point, the intention is not to reject the theories of the
   late 1900s, but through a reinterpretation of ekphrasis put forward an
   example of how digital perspectives on classic concepts could challenge
   or revise more or less taken-for-granted assumptions in the humanities.
   In this context `the digital' is not only a phenomenon that could be
   tied to certain digital objects or used as a digital tool, but as an
   approach to history, with strong critical potential. The aim is to show
   that one of the most important features of our digital culture is that
   it offers new perspectives - not only on current technology - but also
   on literary, cultural and aesthetic historical practices.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Abstract = {{The Transborder Immigrant Tool is a provocative mobile phone app by the
   Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT) that provides sustenance to border
   crossers by leading them to water and guiding them with poetry. Although
   the tool can be applied to any border, the chief border it has been tied
   to and tested on is the US-Mexico border. The EDT present the project as
   an artistic disruption of the tired national political theater staged at
   that border. The piece refocuses attention on the basic human needs of
   those caught in the middle of the stale and stalemated divide. For the
   EDT, every part of the piece participates in this disruption not merely
   the finished app or the poetry but the code as well. In this paper, I
   ask, what would it mean for the code to poetic disruption? One set of
   poetry for the project created by Amy Sara Carroll offers instructions
   for desert survival. By presenting instructions as poems, she offers one
   entre into reading the source code of the app as poetry. Using the
   methods of Critical Code Studies, I read the code of TBT in light of and
   as part of the poetic intervention of this complex performance.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the authors' experience teaching college students
   how to use Google Earth to create atlases of historical Silk Road
   journeys. It argues that a digital humanities classroom, with clearly
   defined assignments and extensive evaluation, is an exemplary setting
   for establishing and verifying genre conventions and review standards.
   Approaches that are developed for the classroom can be modified for
   professional settings. The authors introduce criteria for evaluating
   digital historical atlases as works of humanistic scholarship, and
   suggest that digital humanists do the same for other disciplines and
   genres as well.}},

Title = {{Now is the Future Now? The Urgency of Digital Curation in the Digital
   Humanities}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{In their seminal report, Our Cultural Commonwealth ( 2006), the American
   Council of Learned Societies underscored the need for scholars engaged
   in digital humanities work to leverage their access to data both to
   expand their audience to the general public and to generate new research
   questions. ``Now is the Future Now?{''} argues that the progress made in
   digital humanities toward these goals has depended and will depend not
   only on digital data, but also on their appropriate curation. The
   article defines digital humanities, data, so- called Big Data, and
   digital curation. Next it examines digital curation initiatives in the
   sciences and in the humanities that occurred before the release of Our
   Cultural Commonwealth. It then considers and evaluates the digital
   curation work undertaken in the sciences and in the humanities after the
   report's publication. In theory and in practice digital curation has
   benefited substantially from practices developed and tested first in the
   natural sciences and subsequently adapted for and extended in the
   humanities. Finally, the piece explores the future work necessary to
   facilitate symbiosis between digital curation and digital humanities.
   Collaboration and cooperation, transcending geographical, disciplinary,
   and institutional boundaries, data sharing, policies and planning,
   education and training, sustainability - all remain pressing issues in
   2013.}},

Abstract = {{Are we currently confusing being connected with communicating - and does
   the sort of communication people are typically engaging in on the
   Internet, in social media and when they use their mobile phones merely
   lead to superficial rather than meaningful dialogue? If this is the
   case, it ought to concern Digital Humanities (DH) scholars, many of whom
   continue to be more interested in how we connect than in the substance
   and dialogue of that very connectedness. I would like to argue for a
   better balance between the ``how{''} and the ``what{''} of DH - for a
   qualitative turn of sorts away from an interest in gaining and making
   accessible more information only, to an interest in also making sense of
   and understanding that information. For such a turn, computer scientists
   need input from the humanities whose specialty has always been to turn
   information into knowledge by means of critical interpretation and
   contextualization.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},

Abstract = {{``Theoretical Permutations for Reading Cybertexts{''} is a review essay
   on Markku Eskelinen, Cybertext Poetics: The Critical Landscape of New
   Media Literary Theory (London: Continuum, 2012), and C.T. Funkhouser,
   New Directions in Digital Poetry (London: Continuum, 2012). Both books
   engage new media works and practices in ways that are transformative of
   the conceptual apparatus and tools of literary theory and literary
   analysis. Moving between the deep analysis of the Funkhouser's and the
   high-level abstraction of Eskelinen's will give readers an exhilarating
   sense of just how new media is changing our aesthetical experience and
   our way of thinking and writing about the textual experience.
   Markku Eskelinen's Cybertext Poetics and C.T. Funkouser's New Directions
   in Digital Poetry set new standards for the theory and analysis of
   digital texts. Eskelinen's groundbreaking book synthesizes his research
   of the last decade into a theory for the new media textual condition
   with profound implications for the entire field of poetics. Through
   Eskelinen's transmedial reframing of the operative categories of the
   field, it becomes clear how certain ``universals{''} of literary theory
   have been in fact strongly dependent on a limited corpus of print-based
   situations. Funkhouser's close readings of digital poetry are also
   deeply informed by a hands-on poetics of digital writing and reading
   practices on the web. Building on his historical account of computer
   poetry {[} Funkhouser 2007], his main concern here is to analyze the
   multimedia and programmable specificity of post-WWW digital poetry.
   Eskelinen's permutational descriptions of the narratological and
   ludological variables involved in ergodic and non-ergodic works, and
   Funkhouser's close attention to the signifying dynamics sustained by the
   variability of programmable forms extend the critical landscape for
   thinking about literary poiesis, digital and otherwise.}},

Title = {{Curating Digital Spaces, Making Visual Arguments: A Case Study in New
   Media Presentations of Ancient Objects}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Curating is often seen as a mediation between artist, work, and
   audience, with the curator firmly at the center. The central role of the
   curator has been further emphasized with the rise of the curator as
   artist and the institutional and physical limitations of museum spaces.
   We argue that there are important alternative spaces of meaning to be
   developed between object and audience. Digital curating, in particular,
   allows for greater audience participation, both by expanding the
   potential audience and by allowing visitors to navigate through the
   virtual galleries under their own direction. We contend that by
   facilitating the site visitors' creation of their own visual arguments,
   a new level of audience participation in visual analysis - indeed, in a
   fundamental intellectual and intuitive aspect of curating - is made
   possible. We explore how digital resources can be modified to allow for
   that contextual sense of making a visual argument through arrangement.
   An installation at the University of Houston debuted a new tool for
   digital content management and allows us to make some preliminary
   observations about the process of visual analysis, its role in
   curatorial practice, and explore future directions for work.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{The Simulated Environment for Theatre (SET) offers an alternative to
   static, two-dimensional visualizations of theatrical text by modeling
   the process of moving from text to performance in the Western,
   text-based tradition of live theatre production. Its interface links a
   three-dimensional `Stage View' populated by character avatars to a `Text
   View' enhanced with text visualization tools by means of a central `Line
   of Action' analogous to a timeline. All three parts of the interface can
   be edited; edits in any individual section appear in the others; and all
   three can be played back simultaneously. While emphasizing that the
   traditional medium of theatrical performance is the actor's body moving
   in time and space, and providing a digital analogue for that medium, the
   system also frees users from the limitations of the single, time-bound
   spectator's perspective. Potential applications include theatre
   analysis, theatre pedagogy, and preparation for theatrical production.}},

Abstract = {{The Humanities now confront a new era in cultural representations - the
   digital age. As a consequence, our approach to culture may be modified
   because technology allows us to now visualize our thoughts and theories
   using digital and computing techniques. This research focuses on merging
   humanities research with computational sciences to explore the processes
   involved in culture dynamics. We present an interdisciplinary approach
   that combines literary studies, economics, and agent-based modeling
   (ABM) and give details of how literature maybe used as a data set that
   can be translated into a dynamic Java-based simulation of human
   interactions constructed around Game Theory. Our model of Cross-Cultural
   Cooperation is designed to study culture at various levels of
   granularity simultaneously in order to show how micro-behaviors might
   lead to macro outcomes such as cultural group formation. We present one
   experiment based on the literature of discovery and conquest in the U.S.
   Southwest translated into the language of ABM. Additionally, we explore
   the role of space, time, and population-size in this process and offer a
   discussion of possible future directions for this type of research. The
   creation of our simulator of cultural exchange between individuals of
   differing cultures allows researchers to experiment with ideas about
   first and ongoing contact and speculate with ``What if?{''} scenarios.}},

   Electronic Literature}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Randomly generated content poses problems for theories of digital art:
   such content is resistant to structural theories, which can only provide
   templates, and one cannot assume a shared text for close analysis.
   Instead of reaching fixed endings, such works also tend to be of
   indefinite length or at least suggest indefinite possible combinations.
   I argue that the impact of such works can instead be found in how one
   attempts to work through their underlying grammar, based on limits in
   the algorithms that generate the content - not those limits themselves,
   but how their outlines come to be known. Repetitively iterating through
   these works simultaneously upholds the chance nature of the
   epiphenomenal occurrences while also illustrating the sameness of the
   underlying algorithm over time, creating a future-oriented interpretive
   arc. I examine two works that play off of this technique in different
   ways: Nick Montfort's Taroko Gorge, a poetry generator which uses random
   generation to distill the essence of its object's possibility, and the
   action role-playing game Torchlight, which attempts to elevate chance
   beyond a mere gameplay mechanic and toward an ethic.}},

Abstract = {{Despite DH's long history, it is still perceived as a relatively
   emergent academic discipline which has several implications for its
   ongoing development and acceptance. In order to understand its role in
   supporting the field's development and acceptance, SSHRC commissioned a
   survey of the larger Humanities and Social Science's community to
   understand the issues related to DH's development and acceptance and the
   types of activities that should be funded. The survey results suggest
   there is reason for optimism regarding the growing acceptance of digital
   methods, resources and tools and electronic dissemination as
   instructors, researchers, and students are using and publishing in
   digital outlets and creating and employing digital recourses, methods
   and tools andventuring into new research fields. This trend is likely to
   continue as students and younger scholars continue to embrace the
   digital in all aspects of their personal and professional lives.
   However, this optimism should be tempered to some extent as students and
   junior faculty are still less likely than associate professors to
   present and publish their digital-oriented research for a variety of
   reasons. The field's more senior faculty can mentor their junior
   colleagues and students to this end and shape salary, tenure and
   promotion policies to recognize and reward these efforts. Finally,
   issues remain around the amount of funding required for the initial
   development and ongoing sustainability and relevance of digital
   resources and may become more critical over time. Granting agencies will
   need to evaluate their funding role in this regard.}},

Abstract = {{Print-on-demand (POD) versions of out-of-copyright literary editions
   have recently flooded the digital marketplace, dragging the editorial
   work of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries back into circulation.
   Often assembled by software as facsimile publications or OCR ``plain
   text{''} editions, then printed and delivered before the text is seen by
   human eyes, these POD books are altering how the material weight of the
   past bears on the present. Through a case study of Milton's
   Areopagitica, this essay explores how POD's zombie-like revitalization
   of earlier texts challenges us to broaden our understanding of the
   nature of digital textuality, especially as it pertains to the work of
   electronic editing.}},

Abstract = {{Digital humanities and medieval studies share a long history, beginning
   with one of the first large-scale digital humanities projects, which was
   carried by Father Roberto Busa using IBM's Literary Data Processing
   Center. Why then, do many scholars of historically-minded fields
   consider digital humanities to be a ``helping discipline{''} instead of
   a full-fledged area of study in itself? Beginning with the above
   question, this paper explores the ways in which scholars need not use
   the digital humanities to update historical disciplines or vice versa.
   By examining the pre- and post-print histories of the book, and
   interrogating the ways in which reading technologies and interfaces link
   the past and future of the book together, the past and present histories
   of reading coalesce and offer scholars novel ways of approaching many
   different disciplines that engage with the digital humanities.}},

Title = {{Whence Feminism? Assessing Feminist Interventions in Digital Literary
   Archives}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Abstract = {{This essay is a meditation on the possibility of a feminist assessment
   of digital literary archives and the interdisciplinary tools needed to
   do such work. Using the Women Writers Project and The Orlando Project as
   exemplary instances of digital literary scholarship, I discuss possible
   sites of feminist intervention (content, technological politics, labor
   structures, etc) and the kinds of theoretical paradigms one might use in
   such work. I also argue that such assessments are essential to
   recognizing the ways in which feminist digital literary studies have
   impacted the field of digital humanities.
   Drawing on recent work in technology studies and feminist theory, the
   essay problematizes simplistic celebratory claims and troubles the idea
   that simply saving women's work in digital form is enough. I conclude
   with a set of reflections on the impact of shifting ideas about the
   value of feminist work and theory in both public and scholarly contexts.
   This includes a proposal that more established scholars proactively
   highlight the feminist interventions that they make and that all digital
   literary scholars consider increasing access to not only the work of
   women, but to the technologies that are integral to that access as well.}},

Abstract = {{Embedded in the rich textual record of international copyright law, we
   often encounter a quaint, and perhaps naive definition of the
   ``literary{''} around which the law has crystallized and which has the
   potential to influence the work of all digital humanists, whether they
   think of themselves as literary scholars or not. The first part of this
   article explores how a relatively narrow definition of the
   ``literary{''} as a category of ``high{''} or belletristic cultural
   production has informed the contours of U.S. copyright law, in
   particular. Section 101, Title 17 of the United States Code expressly
   defines ``literary works{''} as any `` works, other than audiovisual
   works, expressed in words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols
   or indicia, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as
   books, periodicals, manuscripts, phonorecords, film, tapes, disks, or
   cards, in which they are embodied{''} {[}Section 101, Title 17]. US
   courts have, however, often employed a narrower, more commonplace
   understanding of the `` literary{''} as an aesthetic category when
   sorting artifacts or content into other legally more significant
   categories such as idea, expression, criticism, parody, and satire. The
   second section of the article considers some of the potential
   implications and consequences of the current regulatory structure for
   the work of digital humanists. Judges engaging in a fair use analysis
   more often than not expect scholarship to come packaged in print
   monographs written in academic language aimed at an audience of
   disciplinary specialists. When they encounter scholarly artifacts that
   depart from those formal expectations and draw from preexisting work,
   judges are less likely to find the use of pre-existing work is fair and
   therefore non-infringing. Finally, the article examines whether the
   literary as a category should be abandoned altogether, or whether
   digital humanists might productively redefine the literary as part of a
   strategy for re-imagining the institutional and legal regulations that
   govern academic work.}},

Abstract = {{Where will all the books go? A version of that question has occupied
   commentary about Amazon's Kindle since news of its release first made
   its way to public attention in September 2007. Posed out of curiosity,
   excitement, as well as trepidation, the question includes anxiety about
   the re-invention of reading embodied by new features and the intricacies
   of downloading policy. In this essay, I focus on disappearance for the
   ways in which it indexes concerns about the Kindle's material impact on
   reading. Tracking these concerns, I turn to three major moments in the
   Kindle's ``biography{''} in order to emphasize Amazon's investment in
   mimicking the transcendence associated with reading and the ways in
   which this investment is met, and at times exceeded, by readerly desires
   to possess that transcendence. That the very name ``Kindle{''} should
   occasion parallels between e-reading and book burning, that Jeff Bezos
   should claim unobtrusiveness as the device's exemplary feature, and that
   Amazon's unannounced deletions of Orwell's 1984 from thousands of Kindle
   libraries should meet with such ire, makes visible the two ideologies of
   reading - on the one hand, the invaluable (because ephemeral) force of
   reading and on the other, reading as a relation of ownership and agency
   - that stand in both an uneasy and profitable tension for Amazon and its
   reader-consumers.}},

Abstract = {{At the core of the work done within the digital humanities is a
   difficult interdisciplinary relationship between the at times divergent
   cognate fields of computer science and the humanities. This paper will
   explore some of the characteristics of the digital humanities and
   examine some of its hard interdisciplinarity relationships. It is the
   contention of the author that one of the central epistemological
   challenges within the field is to empower students to successfully
   manage the thorny interdisciplinary relationship intrinsic to technology
   and the humanities. Without understanding and managing this
   relationship, there is a danger that student projects lapse into
   exceedingly reductive pragmatism or overly theorised clumsiness. The
   author will suggest a model where this hard-interdisciplinary
   relationship may be taught and assessed through the critical use and
   analysis of digital objects within the framework of a Virtual Research

Title = {{Stretched Skulls: Anamorphic Games and the memento mortem mortis}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Abstract = {{From Hans Holbein's The Ambassadors to Robert Lazzarini's skulls,
   anamorphic artworks explore the tension between mathematical models of
   vision and an embodied experience of space. After reviewing the ways in
   which anamorphosis has been deployed as a philosophical tool for
   investigating digital media in terms of human phenomenology,
   specifically through the criticism of Espen Aarseth and Mark Hansen,
   this paper analyzes how contemporary videogames like Sony's Echochrome
   series, levelHead by Julian Oliver, and Mark ten Bosch's forthcoming
   Miegakure technically, aesthetically, and conceptually explore
   anamorphic techniques. While The Ambassadors is famous for its
   anamorphically skewed skull, a classic memento mori, we propose that the
   anamorphic effects of videogames can be more accurately described as a
   memento mortem mortis: not reminders of human mortality, but of a
   nonhuman the death of death. By foregrounding the impossibility of ever
   fully resolving the human experience of computational space, the memento
   mortem mortis in these ``anamorphic games{''} gestures toward
   experiential domains altogether indifferent to human phenomenology to
   create allegories of the beyond.}},

Title = {{Towards a Richer Sense of Digital Annotation: Moving Beyond a
   ``Media{''} Orientation of the Annotation of Digital Objects}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Abstract = {{Digital technology often gives us the chance to re-conceive common
   scholarly practices with the humanities, and one of these is the
   practice of annotation. Whereas many in the digital humanities look at
   annotation through the lens of social media, in this paper we consider
   annotation's already established function in scholarship: to support the
   development of an interpretation of a body of material. It begins by
   applying a ``software application{''} perspective to annotation and it
   notes that personal annotation sits at the nexus between the publishing
   application of the material being annotated, and an interpretation
   development application that aims to support the reader's thinking. Once
   this application orientation is taken up, it becomes evident that it is
   useful to reconceptualise aspects of annotation beyond the
   annotation-of-media focus which the World Wide Web has encouraged in all
   of us. The paper does this by considering annotation in an application
   that is not media oriented in nature, Northwestern University's
   WordHoard, and it explores some of the significance of annotation where
   the application's data model -with its inherent semantic significance
   -is available to be annotated. There is a growing interest in thinking

Abstract = {{The following contributions offer a comprehensive survey of the impeding
   turns in the scholarly agenda of digital studies. In so doing, they
   probe the future cultural scenarios looming beyond digital technologies
   and their related practices, concepts, and perspectives. Such a
   collective interrogation of our digital future investigates the full
   spectrum of the humanities. As a result, our notions of subjectivity,
   identity, consciousness, literacy, text, and medium emerge in these
   essays as significantly altered by the digital in unusual and unexpected
   ways. Papers scrutinize a variegated set of relationships between the
   human neurological network and the networked computer, real and virtual
   spaces, and subjectivity and procedurality. Scholars in this cluster
   reenvision such issues in the light of an all-encompassing ontological
   shift underway as a consequence of the increasingly pervasive presence
   of the digital in our relations with machines and their processes.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Abstract = {{This paper contributes to the literature examining the burgeoning field
   of academic crowdsourcing, by analysing the results of the crowdsourced
   manuscript transcription project, Transcribe Bentham. First, it
   describes how the project team sought to recruit volunteer transcribers
   to take part, and discusses which strategies were successes (and which
   were not). We then examine Transcribe Bentham's results during its
   six-month testing period (8 September 2010 to 8 March 2011), which
   include a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of website
   statistics, work completed by the amateur transcribers, as well as the
   demographics of the volunteer base and their motivations for taking
   part. The paper concludes by discussing the success of our community
   building with reference to this analysis. We find that Transcribe
   Bentham's volunteer transcribers have produced a remarkable amount of
   work -and continue to do so, carrying out the equivalent labour of a
   fulltime transcriber -despite the nature and complexity of the task at
   hand.}},

Title = {{In One's Own Hand: Seeing Manuscripts in a Digital Age}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Abstract = {{As museums increasingly place archival materials on display, a body of
   scholarship has emerged to provide practical advice for staff about
   exhibiting handwritten documents. However, there has as yet been little
   scholarship that problematizes the exhibition of manuscripts and the
   responses they elicit from their audiences. This essay, then,
   investigates the cultural perception of handwriting as an inherently
   unique and authentic embodiment of its writer, the assumption of which
   lies behind its display. Through a series of close readings of responses
   to the sight of the autograph, I examine the ways in which handwriting's
   association with the human body has been historically shaped and
   interpreted; its current function as a locus for concerns about the loss
   or degradation of corporeal identity in an increasingly technologized
   world; and how multimedia museum exhibitions of handwritten documents -
   as digitally manipulable surrogates of original artifacts expose,
   complicate, and break down the oppositions in this cultural discourse.
   Ultimately, I argue, digital interactives are part of a new
   exhibitionary paradigm, which not only offers new ways of considering an
   artifact's essential meaning, but also refines and redefines our
   understanding of human effort, intentionality, and embodiment in a
   digital age.}},

Abstract = {{Research since the early years of the 21st century consistently shows
   that through the years more of our time gets spent using media, that
   being concurrently exposed to media has become a foundational feature of
   everyday life, and that consuming media for most people increasingly
   takes place alongside producing media. Contemporary media devices, what
   people do with them, and how all of this fits into the organization of
   our everyday life disrupt and unsettle well-established views of the
   role media play in society. Instead of continuing to wrestle with a
   distinction between media and society, this contribution proposes we
   begin our thinking with a view of life not lived with media, but in
   media. The media life perspective starts from the realization that the
   whole of the world and our lived experience in it are framed by,
   mitigated through, and made immediate by (immersive, integrated,

Abstract = {{While much valuable scholarship on the digital focuses on particular
   artifacts or historical processes or subcultures, this essay offers a
   preliminary treatment of the digital in general, proposing that the
   digital has its own ontology, a way of being, and that this ontology is
   manifest in the technologies and human relations that define and
   surround the digital. In particular, the digital places a central
   emphasis on abstraction, and digital artifacts and culture demonstrate
   this ontology of abstraction even while remaining concrete. The kinds of
   social structures grouped under the label Web 2.0 exemplify the
   materialized abstraction of the digital, and this essay points out the
   formal and technical features of the digital that carry the abstract
   nature of the binary code into the human relations and behaviors of Web
   2.0.}},

Abstract = {{Despite significant investments in the development of digital humanities
   tools, the use of these tools has remained a fringe element in
   humanities scholarship. Through an open-ended survey and virtual panel
   discussion, our study outlines the experience of historians using
   various digital tools. The results of the study reveal the variety of
   users interested in digital tools as well as their enthusiasm,
   reactions, and frustrations, including the expectations and confusion
   that has created barriers to tool use and to the wider adoption of new
   research methodologies. We suggest that an emphasis on cultivating a
   broader audience must be a concern not only for tool builders but also
   for funders to account adequately for the time and expense of quality
   interfaces and documentation.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2012}},

Number = {{2, SI}},
Abstract = {{This essay takes as axiomatic that the subject of new media - which in
   other contexts we call the user, the reader, the writer (or in
   institutional contexts, the researcher, the teacher, the student.) is a
   subject of language. This subject's engagements with media and, by way
   of media, with other subjects, are determined by relations founded on
   language which French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan terms the social bond
   of discourse.
   I propose that modes of critical engagement and teaching in the
   contemporary digital field, particularly as the field shifts towards a
   more unified disciplinarity and a more secure institutional footing, can
   be described in relation to the graphs of Lacan's ``four discourses{''}
   - of the University, Master, Hysteric, and Analyst. I conclude that
   deliberate reflection on structures of our research and pedagogy, mapped
   by the graphs, may lead us beyond the confidence games of the master and
   the University - on and by which our inquiries are founded and oriented,
   but also narrowed to the side of the hysteric and the analyst, whose
   collaborations are more productive of new forms of knowledge.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},

Number = {{2, SI}},
Abstract = {{The contemporary digital media ecology is one of convergence and
   hybridity. As virtual and technical interfaces intersect in increasingly
   complex formulations, the ability to identify organic vs. technical
   forms has become problematic. Virtual environments predominate within
   ``everyday{''} cultural practice arguably limiting ``real{''} or
   unmediated human experience. The advent of social media artifacts and
   networks in particular - those that create fusions of personal
   experience and communal activity and that support and broadcast
   user-generated content as a foundation for media productions of
   real-life - have made organic bodies and personal experience difficult
   to discern.
   Extending Mark B.N. Hansen's model for identifying embodied experience
   within contemporary ``mixed reality{''} culture, I argue that embodied
   expression is more, not less, present in the contemporary media age.
   Organic expressions, those that emanate from primal, tactile, and motile
   forces and that operate prior to formal mediatization, are at the core
   of many social media artifacts circulated within the networks of
   contemporary culture and operating outside the aesthetics of traditional
   semiotic representation. Recovering the organic body and foregrounding
   its presence in such media asserts the functional non-aesthetic
   principles at work in many social media forms, particularly in those
   dependant on documenting the minutiae of real- life under-represented in
   mainstream and traditional media. As personal and public spaces collide,
   situating the ``me{''} or the embodied subject within production is
   problematic. I identify such embodiment within contemporary social
   media, particularly on YouTube, to illustrate that the human body does
   not operate from a position of ``erasure{''} within social media
   networks and artifacts, and its expressive value is therefore central in
   much current user-generated me-dia.}},

Abstract = {{Malware and criminal operations performed by botnets on the Internet not
   only pose a new threat, but also point to our increasing reliance upon a
   new form of machinic agency, which I call the webbot assemblage. Whereas
   news media coverage of its operations considers only their human
   aspects, mostly in relation to crime and cyberterrorism, Daniel Suarez's
   recent novel Daemon provides a suggestive glimpse into how, in a webbot
   assemblage, new forms of human and machinic agency are complexly
   intricated. The significance of this assemblage becomes further evident
   when it is considered in relation to how the Internet is increasingly
   perceived: no longer as a neutral medium but as an ecosystem defined by
   netwar, software arms races, and the possible evolution of ``low{''}
   forms of artificial life.}},

Abstract = {{Almost since the inception of the industry, the player community has
   been instrumental in preserving video games and other variable media
   art. Drawing on a combination of primary and secondary sources of
   information, including the Preserving Virtual Worlds project (an
   academic investigation into viable models of preservation for videogames
   and 3D virtual worlds based on a series of archiving case studies) and
   the results of a game documentation survey conducted by Donahue, we
   examine how players are taking responsibility for collecting, managing,
   curating, and creating long-term access to computer games. Because our
   interest lies with the contact zone between players and information
   professionals, we also describe and analyze how we and other
   scholar-archivists are collaborating with or relying on the user
   community to preserve virtual worlds, with an eye to how these
   relationships might eventually be codified within a larger preservation
   framework.}},

   between Julianne Nyhan and Willard McCarty}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This interview was carried out with Willard McCarty on Tuesday 27th
   March, 2012 in University College London. He recounts that his earliest
   encounter with computing was in the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in
   Berkley where he worked with semi-automated scanning equipment for the
   Alvarez high-energy physics projects. After his dreams of becoming a
   physicist were thwarted he transferred to Reed College. There he did not
   have the opportunity to take formal training in computing; for the most
   part, Computer Science departments did not exist then. So, he learned to
   programme ``on the job{''} with help from a talented physicist turned
   computer programmer named Bill Gates (no association with Microsoft).
   His first encounter with what we now call digital humanities was at the
   University of Toronto where he worked on the Records of Early English
   Drama project whilst undertaking a PhD on 17th century non-dramatic
   poetry. In 1984/5, as he was finishing his PhD, he accepted an academic
   support role at the Centre for Computing in the Humanities at Toronto,
   where he remained until 1996 when he accepted an academic post in King's
   College London. In Toronto he was keenly aware of the staff-faculty
   divide and the marginalised position of those who used computers in
   Humanities research. Nevertheless, the opportunities that the role
   brought to meet with a range of scholars interested in computing had a
   lasting influence on him. So too, with funding from the Social Sciences
   and Humanities Research Council of Canada he was able to undertake a
   research project on Ovid's Metamorphosis. He closes the interview by
   reflecting on his early involvement with the conference scene and people
   who have influenced him, from academics to his calligraphy teacher Lloyd
   Reynolds.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},

Number = {{2, SI}},
Abstract = {{This paper will briefly survey the historical development of linking
   systems in the Christian Bible, from their theological foundations to
   their formation in the architecture of the printed book. It will then
   examine the apogee of intra-Biblical linking systems in the Thompson
   Chain Reference Bible, particularly its chain-referencing system for
   thematic linking between texts. Finally, it will use this mature print
   technology to consider the state of the hyperlink in current
   Web-interfaces. It will show that while in many ways modern attempts at
   a dynamic hyperlink surpass this elaborate linking system in
   functionality, in a few key functions this old print technology
   out-performs what is commonly and readily available in current
   Web-browsers. In pursing this comparative analysis we aim to demonstrate
   the importance of understanding the organization and navigational
   structure of the codex in designing digital reading environments that
   will meet and surpass the affordances of print.}},

Number = {{2, SI}},
Abstract = {{A Day in the Life of the Digital Humanities ( Day of DH) is a community
   documentation project that brings together digital humanists from around
   the world to document what they do on one day, typically March 18. The
   goal of the project, which has been run three times since 2009, is to
   bring together participants to reflect on the question, ``Just what do
   computing humanists really do?{''} To do this, participants document
   their day through photographs and commentary using one of the Day of DH
   blogs set up for them. The collection of these journals (with links,
   tags, and comments) is, after editing, made available online. This paper
   discusses the design of this social project, from the ethical issues
   raised to the final web of journals and shares some of the lessons we
   have learned. One of the major challenges of social media is getting
   participation. We made participating easy by personally inviting a seed
   group, choosing an accessible technology, maintaining a light but
   constant level of communication prior to the event, and asking only for
   a single day of commitment. In addition, we tried to make participation
   at least rewarding in formal academic terms by structuring the Day of DH
   as a collaborative publication. In terms of improvements, we have over
   the iterations changed the handling ethics clearances for images and
   connected to other social media like Twitter.}},

   and Julianne Nyhan}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This extended interview with Geoffrey Rockwell was carried out via Skype
   on the 28th April 2012. He narrates that he had been aware of computing
   developments when growing up in Italy but it was in college in the late
   1970s that he took formal training in computing. He bought his first
   computer, an Apple II clone, after graduation when he was working as a
   teacher in the Middle East. Throughout the interview he reflects on the
   various computers he has used and how the mouse that he used with an
   early Macintosh instinctively appealed to him. By the mid-1980s he was
   attending graduate school in the University of Toronto and was accepted
   on to the Apple Research Partnership Programme, which enabled him to be
   embedded in the central University of Toronto Computing Services; he
   went on to hold a full time position there. Also taking a PhD in
   Philosophy, he spent many lunch times talking with John Bradley. This
   resulted in the building of text analysis tools and their application to
   Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, as well as some of the
   earliest, if not the earliest, conference paper on visualisation in the
   digital humanities community. He reflects on the wide range of
   influences that shaped and inspired his early work in the field, for
   example, the Research Computing Group at the University of Toronto and
   their work in visual programming environments. In 1994 he applied, and
   was hired at McMaster University to what he believes was the first job
   openly advertised as a humanities computing position in Canada. After
   exploring the opposition to computing that he encountered he reflects
   that the image of the underdog has perhaps become a foundational myth of
   digital humanities and questions whether it is still a useful one.}},

Abstract = {{Harold Short recounts that his interest in Computing and the Humanities
   goes back to when he was an undergraduate in English and French at a
   university in the former Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). There, whilst
   undertaking summer work in the library, he saw first-hand the potential
   of digital methods. After arriving in London in 1972 he took an Open
   University degree in mathematics, computing and systems. Among his early
   influences he identifies the reading he did on matters related to
   cognitive science whilst undertaking a postgraduate certificated in
   education. In the UK he worked at the BBC as programmer, systems analyst
   and then systems manager. In 1988 he moved to King's College London to
   take up the post of Assistant Director in Computing Services for
   Humanities and Information Management. One of his first tasks was to
   work with the Humanities Faculty to develop an undergraduate programme
   in humanities and computing. The first digital humanities conference he
   attended was the first joint international conference of ALLC and ACH,
   held at the University Toronto in 1989, which c. 450 people attended. He
   reflects on aspects of the institutional shape of the field towards the
   end of the 1980s, including the key Centres that existed then, the first
   meeting of the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing ( ALLC)
   and those who were active in it such as Roy Wisbey, Susan Hockey and the
   late Antonio Zampolli. He gives a detailed discussion of the development
   of what is now the Department of Digital Humanities in King's College
   London, both in terms of the administrative and institutional issues
   involved, as well as the intellectual. He also reflects on some of the
   most successful collaborations that the Department has been involved in,
   for example, the AHRC funded Henry III Fine Rolls project, and the
   conditions and working practices that characterised them. He closes by
   discussing his impressions about the movement of scholars into and out
   of the discipline and of the institutional issues that have had an
   impact on digital humanities centres.}},

Abstract = {{The two annotated bibliographies present in this publication document
   and feature pertinent discussions toward the activity of modeling the
   social edition, first exploring reading devices, tools and social media
   issues and, second, social networking tools for professional readers in
   the Humanities. In this work, which is published conjointly with the LLC
   piece ``Toward Modeling the Social Edition: An Approach to Understanding
   the Electronic Scholarly Edition in the Context of New and Emerging
   Social Media, `` we consider a typology of electronic scholarly editions
   adjacent to activities common to humanities scholars who engage texts as
   expert readers, noting therein that many methods of engagement both
   reflect the interrelated nature of long-standing professional reading
   strategies and are social in nature; extending this framework, the next
   steps in the scholarly edition's development in its incorporation of
   social media functionality reflect the importance of traditional
   humanistic activities and workflows, and include collaboration,
   incorporating contributions by its readers and re-visioning the role of
   the editor away from that of ultimate authority and more toward that of
   facilitator of reader involvement.}},

   between Ray Siemens and Anne Welsh}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This extended interview with Ray Siemens was carried out on June 21st at
   Digital Humanities 2011, Stanford University. It explores Siemens' early
   training and involvement in the field that is now known as digital
   humanities. He recalls that his first experience with computing was as a
   video gamer and programmer in high school. He had the opportunity to
   consolidate this early experience in the mid-1980s, when he attended the
   University of Waterloo as an undergraduate in the department of English
   where he undertook, inter alia, formal training in computing. He
   communicates strongly the vibrancy of the field that was already
   apparent during his graduate years (up to c. 1991) and identifies some
   of the people in places such as the University of Alberta, University of
   Toronto, Oxford, and the University of British Columbia who had a
   formative influence on him. He gives a clear sense of some of the
   factors that attracted him to computing, for example, the alternatives
   to close reading that he was able to bring to bear on his literary
   research from an early stage. So too he reflects on computing
   developments whose applications were not immediately foreseeable, for
   example, when in 1986 he edited IBM's TCP/IP manual he could not have
   foreseen that by 1989 TCP/IP would be firmly established as the
   communication protocol of the internet. He closes by reflecting on the
   prescience of the advice that his father, also an academic, gave him
   regarding the use of computing in his research and on his early
   encounters with the conference scene.}},

Title = {{From the Personal to the Proprietary: Conceptual Writing's Critique of
   Metadata}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Abstract = {{The past decade has seen a remarkable proliferation of new works of
   constrained and appropriated writing that prominently incorporate, and
   in turn investigate, metadata schemes. I argue that these works ought to
   be of considerable interest not only to critics of contemporary
   avant-garde writing - but also to media theorists, librarians and
   textual scholars. By emphasizing classification protocols, conceptual
   writing makes an implicit case for the interrelationship of these
   fields. Each of the four main books under discussion here - Tan Lin's
   Seven Controlled Vocabularies, Craig Dworkin's Perverse Library, M.
   Nourbese Philip's Zong! and Simon Morris' Getting Inside Jack Kerouac's
   Head - draws upon pre-existing textual archives. In doing so, these
   books suggest that processes of data storage, classification and
   transmission are key to how poetry is created, recognized and
   disseminated. Conceptual writing's attention to information
   classification protocols offers not only a critique of contemporary
   models of authorship, but also of contemporary frameworks of personal
   agency and intellectual property.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last couple of years, it has become increasingly clear that the
   digital humanities is associated with a visionary and forward-looking
   sentiment, and that the field has come to constitute a site for
   farreaching discussions about the future of the field itself as well as
   the humanities at large. Based on a rich set of materials closely
   associated with the formation of the digital humanities, this article
   explores the visions and expectations associated with the digital
   humanities and how the digital humanities often becomes a laboratory and
   means for thinking about the state and future of the humanities. It is
   argued that this forward-looking sentiment comes both from inside and
   outside the field, and is arguably an important reason for the
   attraction and importance of the field. Furthermore, the author outlines
   a visionary scope for the digital humanities and offers a personal
   visionary statement as the endpoint to the article series.}},

Abstract = {{This critical essay was written for the Prairie Art Gallery catalogue
   presenting Kate Armstrong's and Michael Tippett's Grafik Dynamo! Its
   argument, implied in the catalogue version, can be stated explicitly in
   the present scholarly format, namely that narrative, associated with the
   development of the modern novel in print, is distinctly unsuited to
   literary arts produced in and for the electronic medium. Narrative in
   the Dynamo! is not entirely absent, but its dominance is put into
   question. The same holds for the place of argumentation in critical
   writing. The Dynamo! develops episodically, haunted by the comics, and
   by the popular and literary narratives it samples; the essay develops
   similarly, in blocks of partly autobiographical, partly analytical text.
   Propositions emerge not sequentially or through feats of interpretation,
   but at the moment when a block of text encounters a cited image from the
   Dynamo!
   Another collocation having implications for criticism, is the reading of
   Armstrong/Tippett's work in the context of a particular strain of
   contemporary fiction in print, which itself demonstrates that narrative
   was only ever a mode, one among many and not necessarily the dominant
   mode, in print literature itself. References are made to Pynchon's
   Gravity's Rainbow, to Pynchon's (and Armstrong/Tippett's) modernist
   antecedent, Henry Adams, to non-linear, non-sequential narratives by
   Robert Coover, Don DeLillo, and William Gaddis that are as open to
   innovation formally as they are expansive in subject matter. In this
   context, ``Graphic Sublime{''} also introduces a major, as yet
   unpublished novel from the early 1970s by Phillip Wohlstetter,
   Valparaiso.}},

Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{John Unsworth recounts that he first became involved with computing in
   the Humanities c. 1989 as a new faculty member at North Carolina State
   University where he was hired to teach post-World War II American
   literature. He and his colleagues wanted to set up a new journal as only
   one other journal existed in that area. They were introduced to the
   recently released LISTSERV software and the first issue of the journal
   was circulated on email lists and bulletin boards. It was called
   Postmodern Culture and twenty-two years later is still published by
   Johns Hopkins University Press. It was the first peer-reviewed
   electronic journal in the Humanities; nevertheless, not all senior
   colleagues were in favour of it and, as a junior faculty member, his
   participation in it. He recounts that was not able to avail of formal
   training in computing but he did have technical knowledge of computing,
   mostly picked up while procrastinating on this PhD. By the early 1990s
   he was reading Humanist and attending conferences that focused on
   electronic journals where he encountered a range of academic and
   non-academic projects. In 1993 he moved to the University of Virginia
   where he directed the Institute for Advanced Technology in the
   Humanities (IATH). He reflects on the wide range of people and projects
   that he worked with and that it was around this time that he became
   involved with the community now known as digital humanities. He reflects
   in detail on the first digital humanities conference he attended in
   Paris in 1994 and concludes by discussing some of the changes that the
   advent of the Web has heralded.}},

Title = {{Comic Book Markup Language: An Introduction and Rationale}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Comics, comic books, and graphic novels are increasingly the target of
   seriously scholarly attention in the humanities. Moreover, comic books
   are exceptionally complex documents, with intricate relationships
   between pictorial and textual elements and a wide variety of content
   types within a single comic book publication. The complexity of these
   documents, their combination of textual and pictorial elements, and the
   collaborative nature of their production shares much in common with
   other complex documents studied by humanists-illuminated manuscripts,
   artists' books, illustrated poems like those of William Blake,
   letterpress productions like those of the Kelmscott Press, illustrated
   children's books, and even Web pages and other born-digital media. Comic
   Book Markup Language, or CBML, is a TEI-based XML vocabulary for
   encoding and analyzing comic books, comics, graphic novels, and related
   documents. This article discusses the goals and motivations for
   developing CBML, reviews the various content types found in comic book
   publications, provides an overview and examples of the key features of
   the CBML XML vocabulary, explores some of the problems and challenges in
   the encoding and digital representation of comic books, and outlines
   plans for future work. The structural, textual, visual, and
   bibliographic complexity of comic books make them an excellent subject
   for the general study of complex documents, especially documents
   combining pictorial and textual elements.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2011}},

Abstract = {{Wesley Beal examines John Dos Passos's U.S.A. trilogy (1930-36) to read
   its complex form what the author once referred to as a ``four-way
   conveyor system{''} - as an intricate networking scheme, and considers
   it as an archive of early network thinking. Contrary to traditional
   readings of U.S.A. that discuss its formal properties in terms of
   dispersal and the supposedly ruinous disconnections of modern life, the
   paper argues that the interplay of these formal fragments results in a
   semiotic web that drives Dos Passos's narrative strategy toward a
   totalizing vision of the nation and, indeed, history. Beal's paper deals
   with the progressive widening of network figuration in American
   modernism to think the very politics of national space, and in focusing
   on the machinic dynamics of Dos Passos's form, the article establishes
   network discourses as the organizing principle of several
   pre-digitization modes of production, including Fordism and the modern
   corporation.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Abstract = {{Despite a general interest in exploring the possibilities of multimedia
   and web-based research, the humanities profession has been slow to
   accept digital scholarship as a valid form of intellectual endeavor.
   Questions about labor, peer-review, and co-authorship often arise in
   academic departments' attempts to evaluate digital research in the
   tenure and promotion process. In this essay, we argue that these
   tensions stem from a general misunderstanding of the kinds of ``work{''}
   that goes into producing scholarship in multimedia form. Multimedia
   work, we suggest, places scholars in an extended network that combines
   minds, bodies, machines, and institutional practices, and lays bare the
   fiction that scholars are disembodied intellectuals who labor only with
   the mind. We argue that while traditional ideas of what ``counts{''} as
   scholarship continue to privilege content over form, intellectual labor
   over physical labor, and print over digital media, new media's
   functional (and in some cases even biological) difference from old media

Abstract = {{This essay argues that the urban collective novel serves as an important
   modernist precursor to network narratives. The collective novel is a
   literary form, particularly popular during the 1930s, that explores a
   wide context through a decentered narrative. Previous discussions of
   these novels have focused on them as exemplars of modernist form in
   proletarian literature. However, this essay shows another origin for the
   form in concerns about the metropolis and mass culture that complicates
   our understanding. Drawing on examples from novels by John Dos Passos,
   Daniel Fuchs, Albert Halper, Josephine Herbst, William S. Rollins, Jr.,
   and Josephine Herbst it shows how these texts offered not only radically
   ambivalent assessments of networked existence but often a pessimistic
   view of the possibilities of political community, extending at times to
   specific critiques of communist politics. In its conclusion, the essay
   draws links between these novels and the cinematic network narratives
   that became popular in the first decade of the 21st century.}},

Abstract = {{The following contributions offer a comprehensive survey of the impeding
   turns in the scholarly agenda of digital studies. In so doing, they
   probe the future cultural scenarios looming beyond digital technologies
   and their related practices, concepts, and perspectives. Such a
   collective interrogation of our digital future investigates the full
   spectrum of the humanities. As a result, our notions of subjectivity,
   identity, consciousness, literacy, text, and medium emerge in these
   essays as significantly altered by the digital in unusual and unexpected
   ways. Papers scrutinize a variegated set of relationships between the
   human neurological network and the networked computer, real and virtual
   spaces, and subjectivity and procedurality. Scholars in this cluster
   reenvision such issues in the light of an all-encompassing ontological
   shift underway as a consequence of the increasingly pervasive presence
   of the digital in our relations with machines and their processes.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{As digital humanists have adopted visualization tools in their work,
   they have borrowed methods developed for the graphical display of
   information in the natural and social sciences. These tools carry with
   them assumptions of knowledge as observer-independent and certain,
   rather than observer co-dependent and interpretative. This paper argues
   that we need a humanities approach to the graphical expression of
   interpretation. To begin, the concept of data as a given has to be
   rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken
   and constructed. Next, the forms for graphical expression of capta need
   to be more nuanced to show ambiguity and complexity. Finally, the use of
   a humanistic approach, rooted in a co-dependent relation between
   observer and experience, needs to be expressed according to graphics
   built from interpretative models. In summary: all data have to be
   understood as capta and the conventions created to express
   observer-independent models of knowledge need to be radically reworked
   to express humanistic interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{What is the status of digital literature in contemporary culture? Many
   scholars and practitioners assume that digital literature constitutes a
   contemporary avant-garde, which does its work of experimentation outside
   or in opposition to the mainstream. The notion of the avant-garde might
   seem thoroughly out of date in a consideration of the digital future.
   Important theorists (e.g. Huyssen, Drucker) have argued that the
   avant-garde is no longer viable even for traditional media and art
   practices. On the other hand, the avant-gardes of twentieth-century
   modernism made claims about the function of art that remain surprisingly
   influential today - within the art community and within popular culture.
   As Peter Burger and others have discussed, an important division grew up
   in modernism on the question of whether art should strive for formal
   innovation or for sociopolitical change. Avant-gardes of the twentieth
   century took up positions along a spectrum from pure formalism (e.g. the
   Abstract Expressionists) to overt political action (e.g. the
   Situationists). While the digital literature community is in general
   committed to formal innovation, some are critical of this commitment, in
   part on the political grounds that ( technological) innovation has
   become a byword for the digital culture industry. Although the modernist
   problem is still apparent in some digital art and digital literature
   today, writers such as Jason Nelson seem to be moving beyond that
   dialectic.}},

Abstract = {{Does digital pedagogy have to be electronic? This paper grows out of a
   sense that digital pedagogy is too frequently conceived in terms of
   instructional technologies. Technology, at least in its electrified
   forms, can be a limiting factor in imagining how humanities instruction
   can be ``digital{''}: something to get your hands on, to deal with in
   dynamic units, to manipulate creatively. What might an
   electronically-enabled pedagogy look like if we pulled the plug? This
   paper surveys several examples to suggest that an unplugged digital
   humanities pedagogy can be just as productively disorienting as doing
   humanities digitally, and can potentially help students prepare for and
   contextualize their learning experiences with instructional technologies
   or in online environments.}},

Abstract = {{This article argues that Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio, while it
   cannot be considered a text straightforwardly concerned with technology,
   offers a modernist version of the story cycle that anticipates the
   delocalized and highly structured interconnections facilitated by the
   network. Unlike today's seamlessly embedded networks, however, the
   prototypical form depicted in Winesburg, Ohio functions as a kluge, ``an
   ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing
   whole{''} {[}OED]. Anderson's kluge augurs network technology and
   therefore suggests that the form loomed large in modernists' mind.
   However, Winesburg, Ohio illustrates the network's propensity to foster
   users' inner alienation while enabling their unprecedented connection
   and thereby warns against the antagonistic quality of the network's
   rhizomatic structure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the use of the trope ``x is like a node in a
   network{''} in works of critical theory, and shows it to be an indicator
   of a larger discourse, nodalism, that has its origins in 19th century
   neuroscience and Associationist models of mind. This discourse provides
   a relationship between structure and function that is used in attempts
   to model thought in technological devices, as in the work of Vannevar
   Bush and JCR Licklider. These technological instantiations of nodalism
   in turn provide the material basis for the expansion of the discourse
   into other domains, such as politics and economics. The paper concludes
   by considering the potential positive and negative consequence of
   nodalism, and the role of the digitial humanities in the reproduction of
   this discourse.}},

Title = {{The New Place of Reading: Locative Media and the Future of Narrative}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Abstract = {{Locative technologies hold out the promise to transform literary space
   in all of its dimensions, including its represented spaces, reading
   interfaces, and the very spaces within which literature is produced and
   consumed. Yet, despite the growing use of location-based technologies,
   authors and readers alike have been slow to take to site-specific
   narrative due to limitations inherent in both the current design of
   locative media systems and our received notions of what constitutes the
   narrative experience.
   This paper argues that new mobile reading platforms in general are
   altering conceptions of literary space in highly conflicted ways, by
   radically expanding the sites where narratives can be accessed and
   experienced even as they reinforce a residual notion of literary reading
   as a sedentary and decontextualized experience. Locative media likewise
   hold out the promise of increased mobility and contextual awareness, but
   confront several cultural and technological factors preventing such an
   enhanced emplacement of narrative, factors that current
   performance-oriented approaches cannot fully address. At the level of
   cognitive engagement, the conditioned expectation of being
   ``transported{''} to a remote fictional world interferes with readers'
   appreciation of the locative narrative's close ties to the real world,
   as well as the contextual effects it elicits by means of transportation
   through the actual world. At the technical level, the discontinuous
   algorithms of place that inform the architecture of most locative media
   systems hinder the perception of narrative patterning and flow across
   more extensive spaces.
   Locative media thus operationalize the spatial tension between
   conventionally sedentary modes of literary engagement and new modalities
   of mobility, a tension that is constitutive of our present mediality.
   The study concludes with a discussion of StoryTrek, a next-generation
   locative hypernarrative system designed to enable more complex, dynamic
   and fluid modes of embodied narrative spatiality. By encouraging the
   user to actively form complex narrative links between real and fictional
   spaces, StoryTrek enables utopian forms of spatial play that neutralize
   both the spatial limitations of current locative media design and the
   sedentary reading practices that continue to structure the experience of
   digital literature.}},

   Interactive Fiction}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Existing scholarship on interactive fiction (IF, also known as the text
   adventure) tends to treat it as a video game genre and/or as a category
   of electronic literature. In this essay I argue that IF can be
   understood as participating in traditions of visual prose and ekphrastic
   textuality, insofar as IF consists of room and object descriptions which
   direct the player to visualize the things they describe. Unlike
   traditional ekphrastic literature, however, IF also asks the player to
   take practical actions in response to the images he or she visualizes.
   During the commercial era of IF, ekphrasis was the most effective means
   available of providing players with immersive visual experiences.
   However, graphical video games have now surpassed IF in this area.
   Therefore, in order to justify the continued existence of IF,
   contemporary IF authors have been forced to conceive of the visuality of
   IF otherwise than in terms of the logic of transparency. One strategy
   for doing this, exemplified by Nick Montfort's game, Ad Verbum, is to
   abandon visuality almost entirely and emphasize IF's linguistic and
   textual qualities. An alternative strategy, exemplified by Emily Short's
   game City of Secrets, is to assert that IF is visual in a
   non-transparent way, because IF offers visual experiences which are
   user-generated rather than pre-rendered.}},

   World Ends with You}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Abstract = {{Claims of the supposed disappearance of materiality in digital culture
   often entail a nostalgic reimagining of the supposedly embodied,
   personal or creative aspects of earlier writing technologies, including
   handwriting. Although handwriting was never a fully embodied writing
   technology, critics of transparent computer graphics often characterize
   it as such. This revisionist nostalgia for handwriting is evident not
   only in critical literature but also in contemporary graphical media
   such as video games.
   Two recent Nintendo DS games, Scribblenauts (2009) and The World Ends
   with You (2007), represent two alternative modalities of such nostalgia
   for handwriting. Scribblenauts claims to fully restore the creative
   properties of handwriting, but inevitably fails to do so. By contrast,
   TWEWY claims to offer not handwriting itself but a digital- and
   DS-specific equivalent. Therefore, it opens up possibilities for
   critical reflection on the past meaning of handwriting and on the future
   of the values that handwriting has come to symbolize.}},

Abstract = {{``The Globe is All One: Wars I Have Seen as Proto-Network Narrative{''}
   charts Gertrude Stein's characterization of the human mind as an
   data-processor by tracing the conceptual correspondences between her
   writings and early information theory, including the work of Norbert
   Weiner, Claude Shannon, and Vannevar Bush. The article argues that Stein
   first sees language as data that human beings are compelled to parse in
   even the most contextless and semantically ``noisy{''} frameworks, which
   shapes the purpose and form of Stein's notoriously difficult prose poem,
   ``Tender Buttons{''}; the ease with which meaning can be exchanged
   emphasizes the importance of the ways in which a given meaning is
   selected from a set of possible meanings rather than interpreted or
   revealed. While this may simply reiterate the mode of ``Tender
   Buttons{''} in different terms, the paper's crucial intervention is in
   its positioning of the chance selection of significance as the mode of
   signification that animates her wartime memoir ``Wars I Have Seen{''}.
   Like words in the poem, political identity in occupied France is
   unstable and waits to be parsed in the act of encounters with others and
   with history. In her narrative's foregrounding of and experimental play
   with the conventions of memoir, Stein discovers the shifting nature of
   her main character (herself) in a series of ruminations and chance
   meetings; an early version of the network narrative emerges in the nodal
   structure of the story that undermines chronological and nationalist
   frames of signification.}},

Abstract = {{The research experiment described in this article, ``Readies Online,{''}
   started as a database to make accessible a rare manuscript of important
   modernist poets and writers including Gertrude Stein, William Carlos
   Williams, Ezra Pound, F. W. Marinetti, Kay Boyle, Nancy Cunard, Eugene
   Jolas, and many others. Each of these contributors had sent works
   prepared for Bob Brown's machine, and he called the prepared texts
   readies. In the midst of building the collection of texts, the
   researcher realized that moving the texts through an electronic version
   of Brown's machine, or through the interface constructed on the website
   to simulate Brown's machine, changed how one read - even changed the
   essence of what one read. Speed, pace, direction, and visual cues took
   on new importance already apparent in reading printed texts, but not
   stressed. Punctuation now represented an illegible and
   non-representational, visual cue rather than a direct link to the
   phonocentric pauses and stops that are more commonly represented by
   punctuation. The futures of reading, and the use of new devices like
   e-readers, will have consequences for the definition and practice of
   what we call reading.}},

Abstract = {{As digital humanities projects grow in size and complexity university
   programs will need to adapt, balancing the needs of technological
   systems with the imperatives of the humanities tradition. While it makes
   sense to adapt the accumulated expertise of the commercial and

   approaches enhance rather than undermine the aims of the humanities
   generally. While digital humanists are uniquely positioned to help the
   humanities, care needs to be taken to ensure new project management and
   design techniques sourced from the IT world are applied critically and
   do not undermine the core aims of the discipline. If these caveats are
   kept in mind the IT world has a lot to offer digital humanists, however,
   especially in the field of Enterprise Architecture (EA), which aims to
   produce a holistic, high level view of technological systems with a view
   to understanding social and cultural as well as technological issues.}},

Abstract = {{There is currently an infrastructure turn with very real implications
   for the humanities and digital humanities. It comes not only with
   presumed technology or infrastructure, but also with certain
   assumptions, discursive patterns, and models. This paper analyzes these
   critically and advocates a humanities-based notion of
   cyberinfrastructure, not necessarily built on a science-and-engineering
   paradigm or exclusively grounded in existing humanities infrastructure.
   It is argued that we need to maintain a critical stance while
   simultaneously engaging in the exploration of research issues and
   technologies. There is often a gap between the material details of
   infrastructure and underlying, foundational ideas, and it is suggested
   that a model based on conceptual cyberinfrastructure and design
   parameters can be one way of connecting the ideational level with actual
   implementation. HUMlab at Umea University serves as a case study.}},

Title = {{Avatar Emergency}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Abstract = {{The original usage of avatar referred to the incarnation or human
   appearance of a deity, particularly Vishnu, in Hindu mythology. The term
   was adapted to cyberspace to name one's online persona. This usage has
   come to include every aspect of one's online representation, from the
   icon on a blog, or an email signature to the figure one plays in Second
   Life. Avatar, then, is a practical point of entry for theorizing the
   emergence of the new identity experience of electracy, that is
   supplementing and displacing selfhood, the identity formation of
   literacy. Playing one's avatar is to electracy what writing an essay is
   to literacy. The point addressed in this essay is that an avatar is not
   merely the appearance of one's representation, since through
   interactivity and even telepresence, I am t/here with my image. What is
   it to be/have an image? The answer begins with noting the literal
   meaning of the avatar in Sanskrit: ``Descent.{''} Vishnu has descended
   (taken on embodiment) nine times, to correct a disordered world
   condition. This essay initiates a review of the cultural archive to see
   what is known already about our question (representations of
   ``descent{''}). It is perhaps obvious, considering the prominence of
   Christianity in our heritage, that the West accumulated a huge amount of
   information about becoming body. Two examples are referenced in this
   introductory piece: Krishna and Orpheus.}},

Abstract = {{This article traces the development of two important hypertext systems
   in the history of computing, and the new paradigms they created: the
   Hypertext Editing System (HES) and the File Retrieval and Editing System
   (FRESS). HES was the world's first word processor to run on commercial
   equipment. It was also the first hypertext system that beginners could
   use, and pioneered many modern hypertext concepts for personal use.
   Although the idea of hypertext predates HES and FRESS, this article
   argues that these two systems were successful because they demonstrated
   hypertext to a sceptical public; they were both working prototypes.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Within the field of archival science, recent attention has been paid to
   identifying scholastic practices that will ensure the development of
   innovative research as well as the preparedness of future archival
   educators. Information science, long the academic frame of archival
   programs in the U.S. and elsewhere, currently allows for considerable
   co-expansion with digital humanities innovations when we consider the
   possibility of digital libraries, digital archives, and web-based
   collections integrating a humanist approach to display and users'
   interactivity with cultural objects. This paper reviews a workshop
   dedicated to charting the relationship between digital humanities and
   archival scholarship, as well as the opportunities to refine curricular
   and theoretical development in these two disciplines. The concepts
   expressed here would facilitate the efforts of practitioners to
   critically examine issues of pedagogy, practical training, and
   disciplinary alignment under a goal of sustaining the extraordinary
   expansion of applied humanist theory exemplified in research ventures we
   have seen thus far.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{In this article we propose different methods of encoding, according to
   the TEI Guidelines, three different cases of genetic or compositional
   textual variants found in the autographs of the Italian contemporary
   poet Valerio Magrelli. These encoding experiments reflect the diverse
   nature of the artifacts and represent a critical assessment of the
   effectiveness of present encoding practices for the multidimensional and
   pragmatic aspects of authorial drafts. Thus far, it seems that the TEI
   has yet to offer a convincing theoretical model and adequate practical
   solutions for representing the complex temporal structures normally
   present in manuscripts, and in fluid textual traditions in general. Our
   conclusion is that there is a potential conflict between the linear and
   hierchical nature of current formal language systems such as XML, and
   the intrinsic dynamic nature of the writing process. In such cases we
   may have to rethink present models of document modeling, and to develop,
   within an adequate epistemological framework, a new theory of digital
   text.}},

Abstract = {{This extended interview between founding H-Urban editor Wendy Plotkin
   and H-Urban reviews editor Sharon Irish traces the early history of
   online scholarly communication via H-Net, H-Urban, and COMM-ORG,
   informed by Plotkin's background as a planner and community activist in
   the 1970s and 1980s. After work with community development corporations
   on the East Coast, Plotkin entered graduate school in urban history at
   the University of Illinois at Chicago. During this period in the early
   nineties, Plotkin had a job with the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), and
   then collaborated on the development of the forum that became H-Net. In
   addition to standards and protocols about new communication
   technologies, face-to-face relationships grew out of online exchanges,
   often with lively disagreements about the direction of H-Net. Plotkin's
   own broadening use of digital tools prompts her concluding reflections
   on historians' continuing need to use the Internet to overcome physical
   and intellectual fragmentation, and how the Internet has democratized
   the field of history.}},

Abstract = {{While the purpose and direction of tools and tool development for the
   Digital Humanities have been debated in various forums, the value of
   tool development as a scholarly activity has seen little discussion. As
   a way of filling this gap, the authors conducted an online survey of
   developers of digital humanities tools in March 2008. The survey focused
   on their perceptions of their work, how they felt their tool development
   fit into a structure of academic rewards, and the value of tool
   development as a scholarly pursuit. Survey results indicate that tool
   development is indeed considered a scholarly activity by developers, but
   recognition of this work and rewards for it lag behind rewards for
   traditional scholarly pursuits (such as journal articles and book
   publication). This paper presents a summary of the results of the
   survey, ending with some suggestions for further research.}},

Abstract = {{The digital humanities is increasingly becoming a ``buzzword{''}, and
   there is more and more talk about a broadly conceived, inclusive digital
   humanities. The field is expanding and at the same time being
   negotiated, and this article explores the idea of a broadly conceived
   landscape of digital humanities in some depth. It is argued that
   awareness across this landscape is important to the future of the field.
   The study starts out from typologies of digital humanities, a
   ``flythrough{''} of the landscape, and a discussion of what being a
   digital humanist entails. The second part is an exploration of four
   concrete encounters: ACTLab at University of Texas at Austin, the
   Humanities Arts Science Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC), the
   Humanities Computing Program at the University of Alberta, and Internet
   Studies. In the third part of the article, it is suggested that a model
   based on paradigmatic modes of engagement between the humanities and
   information technology can help chart and understand the digital
   humanities. The modes of engagement analyzed are technology as a tool,
   study object, expressive medium, exploratory laboratory and activist
   venue.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Medievalists typically resort to parchment for primary research and when
   editing their sources. Not always accurately catalogued, manuscripts
   copied onto animal skins may have started life in the same workshop but
   over the centuries have become dispersed, coming to rest in libraries
   all over the world; bringing these together entails travel, microfilm
   purchases and reassembly and collation of the data within reach of a
   microfilm reader. These unwieldy machines afford only moderate scope for
   exploring single manuscripts at close quarters. High-resolution
   digitisation yields not just better surrogates in full colour; it allows
   for the development of additional research tools using image compression
   and manipulation, and new modes of representation, e.g. juxtaposed
   display of several related witnesses. This paper outlines research
   questions underpinning the development of an electronic tool for
   viewing, transcribing and manipulating manuscripts; it moves on to show
   how the viewer can be adapted for access from remote sites, to compare
   and annotation one or more witnesses (interactively and in real time),
   and for use as an integral part of an online edition. Finally, it
   explores how it can be deployed for use on projects taking knowledge
   outside the academy: in museums, galleries and other public spaces.}},

Title = {{Vive la Difference! Text Mining Gender Difference in French Literature}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a corpus of 300 male-authored and 300 female-authored
   French literary and historical texts is classified for author gender
   using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) implementation SVMLight,
   achieving up to 90\% classification accuracy. The sets of words that
   were most useful in distinguishing male and female writing are extracted
   from the support vectors. The results reinforce previous findings from
   statistical analyses of the same corpus, and exhibit remarkable
   cross-linguistic parallels with the results garnered from SVM models
   trained in gender classification on selections from the British National
   Corpus. It is found that female authors use personal pronouns and
   negative polarity items at a much higher rate than their male
   counterparts, and male authors demonstrate a strong preference for
   determiners and numerical quantifiers. Among the words that characterize
   male or female writing consistently over the time period spanned by the
   corpus, a number of cohesive semantic groups are identified. Male
   authors, for example, use religious terminology rooted in the church,
   while female authors use secular language to discuss spirituality. Such
   differences would take an enormous human effort to discover by a close
   reading of such a large corpus, but once identified through text mining,
   they frame intriguing questions which scholars may address using
   traditional critical analysis methods.}},

   Differences in Language Use in Authors and their Characters}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Machine learning and text mining offer new models for text analysis in
   the humanities by searching for meaningful patterns across many hundreds
   or thousands of documents. In this study, we apply comparative text
   mining to a large database of 20th century Black Drama in an effort to
   examine linguistic distinctiveness of gender, race, and nationality. We
   first run tests on the plays of American versus non-American playwrights
   using a variety of learning techniques to classify these works,
   identifying those which are incorrectly classified and the features
   which distinguish the plays. We achieve a significant degree of
   performance in this cross-classification task and find features that may
   provide interpretative insights. Turning our attention to the question
   of gendered writing, we classify plays by male and female authors as
   well as the male and female characters depicted in these works. We again
   achieve significant results which provide a variety of feature lists
   clearly distinguishing the lexical choices made by male and female
   playwrights. While classification tasks such as these are successful and
   may be illuminating, they also raise several critical issues. The most
   successful classifications for author and character genders were
   accomplished by normalizing the data in various ways. Doing so creates a
   kind of distance from the text as originally composed, which may limit
   the interpretive utility of classification tools. By framing the
   classification tasks as binary oppositions (male/female, etc), the
   possibility arises of stereotypical or ``lowest common denominator{''}
   results which may gloss over important critical elements, and may also
   reflect the experimental design. Text mining opens new avenues of
   textual and literary research by looking for patterns in large
   collections of documents, but should be employed with close attention to
   its methodological and critical limitations.}},

Title = {{The Digital Future is Now: A Call to Action for the Humanities}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{The digital humanities are at a critical moment in the transition from a
   specialty area to a fullfledged community with a common set of methods,
   sources of evidence, and infrastructure - all of which are necessary for
   achieving academic recognition. As budgets are slashed and marginal
   programs are eliminated in the current economic crisis, only the most
   articulate and productive will survive. Digital collections are
   proliferating, but most remain difficult to use, and digital scholarship
   remains a backwater in most humanities departments with respect to
   hiring, promotion, and teaching practices. Only the scholars themselves
   are in a position to move the field forward. Experiences of the sciences
   in their initiatives for cyberinfrastructure and eScience offer valuable
   lessons. Information-and data-intensive, distributed, collaborative, and
   multi-disciplinary research is now the norm in the sciences, while
   remaining experimental in the humanities. Discussed here are six factors
   for comparison, selected for their implications for the future of
   digital scholarship in the humanities: publication practices, data,
   research methods, collaboration, incentives, and learning. Drawing upon
   lessons gleaned from these comparisons, humanities scholars are ``called
   to action{''} with five questions to address as a community: What are
   data? What are the infrastructure requirements? Where are the social
   studies of digital humanities? What is the humanities laboratory of the
   21st century? What is the value proposition for digital humanities in an
   era of declining budgets?}},

Abstract = {{The case of the Orlando Project offers a useful interrogation of
   concepts like completion and finality, as they emerge in the arena of
   electronic publication. The idea of ``doneness{''} circulates
   discursively within a complex and evolving scholarly ecology where new
   modes of digital publication are changing our conceptions of textuality,
   at the same time that models of publication, funding, and archiving are
   rapidly changing. Within this ecology, it is instrumental and indeed
   valuable to consider particular tasks and stages done, even as the
   capacities of digital media push against a sense of finality. However,
   careful interrogation of aims and ends is required to think through the
   relation of a digital project to completion, whether modular,
   provisional, or of the project as a whole.}},

Abstract = {{Epigraphy as a discipline has evolved greatly over the centuries. Many
   epigraphists in the last 20 years have been investigating how to use
   digital technology to advance their research, but until the present
   decade, these undertakings were restrained by aspects of the technology.
   The late 1990s will be seen as a watershed moment in the transition from
   print-based to born-digital epigraphic publication. At present, the
   majority of new editions are still published solely in print, but by
   2017 we believe this circumstance will change drastically. The history
   of epigraphy makes it quite clear that such transitions are natural to
   the discipline.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{In this article we argue for the necessity of a digital edition to most
   accurately represent the textual tradition of the Homeric epics and to
   better understand the oral performance tradition that created the poems.
   We demonstrate how such a digital criticism would differ from the
   traditional textual criticism as practiced for editions in print and
   suggest how a digital criticism might open new avenues for the
   interpretation of the poetry. In defining our needs and goals for a
   digital edition, we discuss what our project has in common with other
   digital editions of literary works, but how the oral, traditional nature
   of the poetry creates special requirements as well. In addition to
   elaborating the editorial approach for the project, we reaffirm the
   principles of collaboration, international standards, and open access
   that we have learned from Ross Scaife, the founder of the Stoa
   Consortium.}},

Abstract = {{After centuries of image deprivation, we now bathe in a sea of pictures,
   most of them digitized at some stage. In the 1990s, as humanists began
   to sense the advantages of networked computing on the web, they
   conceived major new editorial projects that would depend to an
   extraordinary degree upon the documentary power of pictures. Despite
   evident progress in devising sturdy and responsive standards, images,
   and tools, stubborn problems persist in several key areas that are
   explored here through an overview of issues that arise as the William
   Blake Archive acquires images, prepares them for reproduction, and makes
   them available for manipulation by its users. Editing electronic images
   in so unsettled and unsettling an environment generates the provisional
   success - weak success - that is utterly characteristic of X-editing,
   electronic scholarly editing in our time. Our dependence on current
   technology and the expertise of others is not a remediable condition. We
   must play the game as it presents itself, making the compromises that
   are necessary, and move ahead.}},

Title = {{What Your Teacher Told You is True: Latin Verbs Have Four Principal
   Parts}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{We describe two different strategies for generating the morphology of
   Latin verbs. First, we hand-code default inheritance hierarchies in the
   KATR formalism, treating inflectional exponents as markings associated
   with the application of rules by which complex word forms are deduced
   from simpler roots or stems. The high degree of similarity among verbs
   of different conjugation classes allows us to formulate general rules;
   these general rules are, however, sometimes overridden by
   conjugation-specific rules. This approach allows linguists to gain an
   appreciation for the structure of verbs, gives teachers a foundation for
   organizing lessons in morphology, and provides students a technique for
   generating forms of any verb. Second, we start with a paradigm chart,
   then automatically remove common parts and redundant morphosyntactic
   property sets (columns), combine similar conjugations (rows), and
   generate the KATR theory that produces a complete table of forms for a
   set of lexemes. This second approach automatically determines principal
   parts (for Latin, we verify that there are four), groups inflection
   classes into super-classes, and builds full paradigm charts.}},

Title = {{The Radical Historicity of Everything: Exploring Shakespearean Identity
   with Web 2.0}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This article presents the results of a semester-long project designed to
   determine how effectively interactive Web 2.0 technology can facilitate
   collaborative research in undergraduate learners. The study was
   conducted during a 2007 advanced Shakespeare course at the University of
   Central Florida that focused heavily on a new historicist approach to
   studying literature. In this paper we first establish the theoretical
   foundation for this particular approach to literary studies, then
   discuss more in-depth how the collaborative, inter-connective nature of
   wikis allowed students to witness first-hand some of the concealed
   assumptions enmeshed in the creation of historical explanation or
   narrative. We also discuss how, in thinking about the past, this
   technology allowed our students realize some of the stakes in describing
   history for the present. In other words, having students create wikis
   based on the social identities that recur in Shakespeare's works
   developed an implicit awareness of motives for ``doing{''} history. We
   also show how employing open source technology in a localized classroom
   setting can assuage some of the gaps we experience in trying to provide
   enough period coverage while also attending to theoretical apparatus and
   students' experience of meaningful connections to material. On a larger
   scale, creating inquiry-based projects can alleviate some of the
   humanities' disengagement from the ``real world{''} that many have been
   suggesting of late.}},

Title = {{Service-Oriented Software in the Humanities: A Software Engineering
   Perspective}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Software Engineering, as a sub-discipline of the broader field of
   computer science, is concerned with the production, use, and maintenance
   of large, complex software systems. On first inspection, the set of
   managerial and technical activities involved in software engineering
   appears to be somewhat orthogonal to core research activity in the
   humanities, being concerned more with the production of research-
   enabling software systems than the research itself. However, as the
   scale of software used in digital humanities has increased, it is
   becoming clear that there are ways in which software engineering can
   inform, inspire, and aid in the management of the larger-scale software
   systems now being constructed in these disciplines. In particular, the
   development of service technology to aid in the production of flexible
   software systems for business now offers opportunities, not only for
   collaborative data sharing, but also the modelling, capture,
   provenancing, and replay of the research (and possibly creative) process
   itself.
   This paper examines, from the perspective of a software engineer
   relatively new to the digital humanities, how the recent developments in
   service-oriented architectures could be used to enable new approaches to
   digital enquiry in the arts and humanities. The first part of the paper
   presents a brief history of software engineering, with particular
   reference to the aspects that have led to service-oriented
   architectures. In the second part, the paper offers some thoughts on how
   certain aspects of service-oriented architectures could be used to
   enable new kinds of computerbased research and practice in the arts and
   humanities. It also introduces important national initiatives in this
   area, such as the JISC e-Framework programme for Higher Education.}},

Abstract = {{The nature of the academic lecture has changed with the introduction of
   wi-fi and cellular technologies. Interacting with personal screens
   during a lecture or other live event has become commonplace and, as a
   result, the economy of attention that defines these situations has
   changed. Is it possible to pay attention when sending a text message or
   surfing the web? For that matter, does distraction always detract from
   the learning that takes place in these environments? In this article, we
   ask questions concerning the texture and shape of this emerging economy
   of attention. We do not take a position on the efficiency of new
   technologies for delivering educational content or their efficacy of
   competing for users' time and attention. Instead, we argue that the
   emerging social media provide new methods for choreographing attention
   in line with the performative conventions of any given situation. Rather
   than banning laptops and phones from the lecture hall and the classroom,
   we aim to ask what precisely they have on offer for these settings
   understood as performative sites, as well as for a culture that equates
   individual attentional behavior with intellectual and moral aptitude.}},

   Classification in the Encyclopedie}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{The Encyclopedie of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert was one of
   the most important and revolutionary intellectual products of the French
   Enlightenment. Mobilizing many of the great - and the not-so-great -
   philosophes of the 18th century, the Encyclopedie was a massive
   reference work for the arts and sciences, which sought to organize and
   transmit the totality of human knowledge while at the same time serving
   as a vehicle for critical thinking. In its digital form, it is a highly
   structured corpus; some 55,000 of its 77,000 articles were labeled with
   classes of knowledge by the editors making it a perfect sandbox for
   experiments with supervised learning algorithms. In this study, we train
   a Naive Bayesian classifier on the labeled articles and use this model
   to determine class membership for the remaining articles. This model is
   then used to make binary comparisons between labeled texts from
   different classes in an effort to extract the most important features in
   terms of class distinction. Re-applying the model onto the original
   classified articles leads us to question our previous assumptions about
   the consistency and coherency of the ontology developed by the
   Encyclopedists. Finally, by applying this model to another corpus from
   18th century France, the Journal de Trevoux, or Memoires pour l'Histoire
   des Sciences \& des Beaux-Arts, new light is shed on the domain of
   Literature as it was understood and defined by 18th century writers.}},

Title = {{Conjectural Criticism: Computing Past and Future Texts}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Broadly conceived, this article re-imagines the role of conjecture in
   textual scholarship at a time when computers are increasingly pressed
   into service as tools of reconstruction and forecasting. Examples of
   conjecture include the recovery of lost readings in classical texts, and
   the computational modeling of the evolution of a literary work or the
   descent of a natural language. Conjectural criticism is thus concerned
   with issues of transmission, transformation, and prediction. It has
   ancient parallels in divination and modern parallels in the comparative
   methods of historical linguistics and evolutionary biology.
   The article develops a computational model of textuality, one that
   better supports conjectural reasoning, as a counterweight to the
   pictorial model of textuality that now predominates in the field of
   textual scholarship. ``Computation{''} is here broadly understood to
   mean the manipulation of discrete units of information, which, in the
   case of language, entails the grammatical processing of strings rather
   than the mathematical calculation of numbers to create puns, anagrams,
   word ladders, and other word games. The article thus proposes that a
   textual scholar endeavoring to recover a prior version of a text, a
   diviner attempting to decipher an oracle by signs, and a poet exploiting
   the combinatorial play of language collectively draw on the same library
   of semiotic operations, which are amenable to algorithmic expression.
   The intended audience for the article includes textual scholars,
   specialists in the digital humanities and new media, and others
   interested in the technology of the written word and the emerging field
   of biohumanities.}},

Abstract = {{The word ``finish{''} can mean two things that have quite different
   implications for large-scale humanities computing projects: ``to bring
   to completion; to make or perform completely; to complete{''} and also
   ``to perfect finally or in detail; to put the final and completing
   touches to (a thing).{''} The word ``finish{''} is just not part of the
   deal for the Linguistic Atlas Project in either sense. However, granting
   agencies must ask ``what do you want money for this time?{''} and, from
   this viewpoint, the Atlas Project consists of a series of particular
   tasks or experiments, each one of which is capable of being
   ``finished{''} in both senses of the word. This paper discusses the
   reality of funding, deadlines, and deliverables, as they relate to the
   sequence of tasks that make up the larger Atlas Project. There are no
   once-and-done, permanent solutions. The largest humanities computing
   projects require continuing care and maintenance, and the best way
   forward is to create some sort of stable institutional setting for large
   projects that will provide continuity and baseline resources for the
   work.}},

   The Library Example}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{The past decade has seen XML widely adopted within a variety of
   communities, including the digital library community. While it now plays
   a critical role in the infrastructure of many digital library
   operations, XML's promise of interoperability of data across systems and
   organizations has not been fully realized within digital libraries. The
   reasons for this are not primarily technical in origin, but social, and
   relate to the cultures of XML's designers and XML language implementors,
   and a failure on the part of the digital library community to grapple
   with the sociotechnical nature of XML and its implementation. Possible
   strategies for addressing these issues of interoperability might include
   reduction of the flexibility afforded by specific XML-based markup
   languages used by the digital library community, and an increased focus
   on standardizing translations between various communities of practice
   use of such markup languages.}},

Title = {{Locating Grid Technologies: Performativity, Place, Space: Challenging
   the Institutionalized Spaces of e-Science}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{This paper arises out of a brief period in the early-to mid-2000s when
   the British funding and research climate facilitated a relationship
   between the technical, operational language of eScience and the creative
   and performing arts. It concerns the ways in which live creative
   practices produce media traces that are fractured across screens and
   networks to produce new spatial relations between live events and their
   records. The split and contradictory subjectivities produced in these
   highly mediatized environments bring to the fore creative tensions
   between the live event and the recorded document. That is, the
   discourses, technologies and practices (if we may separate these) of
   e-Science not only produce new, spatial connections between events and
   their archives, they enact the ``liveness{''} of archives as they are
   accessed and recombined to produce new art forms. Locating Grid
   Technologies: Performativity, Place, Space, a research workshop series
   funded by the A\& H e-Science Initiative in its 2006 round, aimed to
   investigate how eScience technologies might inform new understandings of
   space and time for distributed, creative research practices. Arts and
   technology researchers from the UK, US and Japan met to generate,
   analyze and re-use audio-visual documents of distributed practice-led
   research. Specifically, the project sought to combine and repurpose
   e-Science tools in order to investigate the spatial relationships
   produced between time-based, live events and their immediately
   mediatized traces. This paper investigates those performative
   fragmentations of place and space. It suggests that the potentialities
   and pitfalls of e-Science tools and technologies present fertile
   material for the arts researcher, particularly within the area of
   practice-based research: from the politics of surveillance to the
   aesthetics of video compression, from the ethics of multidisciplinary
   collaboration to the theoretical implications of mixing video time and
   space with the time and space of the performance event.}},

   text-based electronic scholarship, especially undertakings that share

   Price considers how current terms describing digital scholarship both
   clarify and obscure our collective enterprise. Price argues that the
   terms we use have more than expressive importance. The shorthand we
   invoke when explaining our work to others shapes how we conceive of and

Abstract = {{Electronic literature is an important evolving field of artistic
   practice and literary study. It is a sector of digital humanities
   focused specifically on born-digital literary artifacts, rather than on
   using the computer and the network to redistribute, analyze, or
   recontextualize artifacts of print culture. Works of electronic
   literature appeal to configurative reading practices. The field of
   electronic literature is based on a gift economy and developing a
   network-based literary culture built on the collaborative practices of a
   globally distributed community of artists, writers, and scholars. This
   article situates the development of the field of electronic literature
   within academe, some of the institutional challenges currently
   confronting the field, and its potential for further development.}},

Title = {{Exploring Historical RDF with Heml}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{The Web, though full of historical information, lacks a means of
   organizing that information, searching on it or visualizing it. The
   Historical Event Markup and Linking Project (Heml) was begun six years
   ago to explore how disparate historical materials on the Internet can be
   navigated and visualized, and for the past four years has used an XML
   data format defined in W3C Schemas. This format aims for conforming data
   that can be quickly parsed but provide a variety of facets on which to
   search for historical materials. While the project's graphical
   visualizations are in some respects successful, they have revealed some
   deficiencies in the underlying data format: it ought to provide for
   nested events, it ought to represent relations of causality between
   events and it ought to express the varieties of scholarly opinion about
   the attributes of events. By encoding the Heml data in the Resource
   Description Framework (RDF) it is possible to undertake these
   improvements. Moreover, an RDF-encoded Heml process provides easier
   access to CIDOC-CRM data into Heml events. Finally, a historical RDF
   language would simplify the discovery of references to historical events
   in digitized texts, thereby automating a growing network of historical
   information on the Web.}},

Title = {{The Ends of Editing}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Many ``ends{''} of editing in the digital world may be distinguished.
   One may speak of ``end{''} as in the supersession of one model of
   editing (the ``intentionalist,{''} ``definitive-text{''} model) by
   another (the multiple texts, multiply-intentioned views enabled by
   digital methods). One may speak of ``end{''} as in aim: not only the aim
   of the author or authors, but also the aims of the editor or editors.
   These questions were already complicated in the print world; the advent
   of digital methods has both focussed and widened the contests around
   these concepts. The essay reviews some of these questions, with examples
   drawn from (inter alia) the utterances of the two George Bushes, from
   editions with which the author is associated of Chaucer, Dante, and of
   Armenian texts, from the eColi genome, and from Barack Obama's
   discussion of different viewpoints on the Constitution of the United
   States. The essay concludes that a huge shift is indeed underway in the
   editing world, towards a more open and participatory model of editing
   and reading.}},

Title = {{Designing Data Mining Droplets: New Interface Objects for the Humanities
   Scholar}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe the design of a number of alternative
   interface ``droplets{''} that are intended for use by humanities
   scholars interested in applying data mining and information
   visualization tools to the task of hypothesis formulation. The trained
   droplets provide several functions. Their primary purpose is to
   encapsulate the results of the software training phase. They can be
   saved for future re-use against other collections or combinations of
   collections. They can be modified by having the user accept or reject
   features identified by the data mining software. Finally, they can also
   contain choices for how to display and organize items in the collection.
   The opportunity to develop a new interface object presents the designer
   with the challenge of effectively communicating what the tool is good
   for and how it is used. This paper outlines the design process we
   followed in creating the visual representations of these interface
   objects, describes the communicative strengths and weaknesses of a
   number of alternative designs, and discusses the importance of the study
   of new interface objects as the means of providing the user with new
   interface affordances.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Incunabula, or books printed before 1500, are extremely difficult and
   expensive to convert to digital form. The primary challenges arise from
   the use of non-standard typographical glyphs based on medieval
   handwriting to abbreviate words. Further difficulties are also posed by
   the practice of inconsistently marking word breaks at the end of lines
   and reducing or even eliminating spacing between some words. As such,
   these documents form a distinct genre of electronic document that poses
   unique challenges for conversion to digital form. From 2005-2007, the
   Preservation and Access Research and Development Program at the National
   Endowment for the Humanities funded a study to explore methods for
   digitizing these difficult texts. This paper describes some of the
   results of that project.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This article offers an analysis of the video game in terms of the
   experience of gameplay, starting with the concept of the avatar, which
   is central to all video games. The avatar is typically described as our
   second self in the virtual world of the game. The paper challenges this
   theory, suggesting that the avatar is better understood as a set of
   possible interactions, and proposes a second concept, the avatari. If
   the avatar is our second self, the avatari is the rebellious figure on
   the screen that we cannot quite control, and that jumps into the pit,
   gets hit by the enemy, or otherwise fails despite our best efforts to
   succeed. Conceptualizing video games in terms of the avatar and avatari
   enables thinking about video games via a more sophisticated and
   productive model of interactivity than many of the existing paradigms.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},

Abstract = {{Since the early 1990s, theorizing in the digital humanities has often
   celebrated open-endedness and incompletion as inherent qualities of
   digital work. But a scholarly publisher undertaking preparation and sale
   of digital objects cannot altogether dispense with traditional notions
   of deadlines and completion if those publications are to enter the dual
   marketplaces of peer review and institutional purchase. The Electronic
   Imprint of the University of Virginia Press was funded in 2001 with the
   goal of bringing born-digital scholarly projects under the aegis of the
   same review and marketing system that applies to books. In this article
   I describe how we defined the criteria for ``done-ness{''} in creating
   two very different projects, a born-digital edition of Herman Melville's
   Typee manuscript and a conversion of the letterpress Papers of George
   Washington into a digital edition. Our experience suggests that it is
   possible to categorize different genres of digital creations based on
   the extent to which intrinsic criteria for ``done-ness{''} can be
   applied to them, and that decisions about completeness are always
   subject to extrinsic factors as well, such as budgetary constraints and
   the pressures created by competition and the evolution of standards.}},

Abstract = {{As the amount of scholarly material published in digital form increases,
   there is growing pressure on content producers to identify the needs of
   expert readers and to create online tools that satisfy their
   requirements. Based on the results of a study conducted by the Public
   Knowledge Project and introduced at Digital Humanities 2006 (Siemens,
   Willinsky and Blake), continued and augmented since, this paper
   discusses the reactions of Humanities Computing scholars and graduate
   students to using a set of online reading tools. The results of our
   study reveal both the potential strengths and perceived weaknesses of
   online reading environments. Understanding how users read and evaluate
   research materials, anticipating users' expectations of the reading
   tools and resources, and addressing user concerns about the availability
   of online material will lead to improvements in the design and features
   of online publishing.}},

   (and, indeed, what isn't today), Sporton argues that beyond the effect
   of explaining this is something to do with technology, there is an
   emergent ``e-culture{''} that reunites the arts and sciences after two
   hundred years of separate development within the academy. An
   ``e-Culture{''} emerges that reflects the values, opportunities and
   restrictions of Internet as a research environment. The potential of
   that environment requires a mindset focussed on collaboration to achieve

Abstract = {{This article presents an examination of how digital humanities is
   currently conceived and described, and examines the discursive shift
   from humanities computing to digital humanities. It is argued that this
   renaming of humanities computing as digital humanities carries with it a
   set of epistemic commitments that are not necessarily compatible with a
   broad and inclusive notion of the digital humanities. In particular, the
   author suggests that tensions arise from the instrumental, textual and
   methodological focus of humanities computing as well as its relative
   lack of engagement with the ``digital{''} as a study object. This
   article is the first in a series of four articles attempting to describe

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{e-Science and high performance computing (HPC) have the potential to
   allow large datasets to be searched and analysed quickly, efficiently,
   and in complex and novel ways. Little application has been made of the
   processing power of grid technologies to humanities data, due to lack of
   available large-scale datasets, and little understanding of or access to
   e-Science technologies. The Researching e-Science Analysis of Census
   Holdings (ReACH) scoping study, an AHRCfunded e-science workshop series,
   was established to investigate the potential application of grid
   computing to a large dataset of interest to historians, humanists,
   digital consumers, and the general public: historical census records.
   Consisting of three one-day workshops held at UCL in Summer 2006, the
   workshop series brought together expertise across different domains to
   ascertain how useful, possible, or feasible it would be to analyse
   datasets from Ancestry and The National Archives using the HPC
   facilities available at UCL. This article details the academic,
   technical, managerial, and legal issues highlighted in the project when
   attempting to apply HPC to historical data sets. Additionally, generic
   issues facing humanities researchers attempting to utilise HPC
   technologies in their research are presented.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we evaluate approaches using logic reasoning applied to
   an ontology for literary characters. The inference tool Racer and the
   programming language Prolog were tested and compared to see if they can
   serve as a computer assisted approach in this scenario.
   Both offer options to draw inferences, but the usage requests a good
   comprehension of logics. Intuitive and individual queries are also
   difficult to produce with solely logic constructs. Furthermore,
   information in humanities is often vague, ambiguous, or even
   contradictory. Solving such problems by logic reasoning which is simply
   based on true or false conclusions will become challenging and might
   exceed the limits of logic reasoning.
   At the moment, to the author's knowledge, only few such approaches,
   especially in literature studies, have been published. Existing
   approaches show promising results in modelling information in
   humanities. Therefore, further research should be directed to make
   ontologies and further approaches like logic reasoning even more popular
   and applicable in the humanities and literature studies.}},

Abstract = {{With Humanities Computing and New Media identified as emerging fields of
   significant strength, it is time for well-funded and fully supported
   programs in Digital Humanities to be described, developed, and
   implemented in the university. This article is a description of an
   attempt to build such a program from the ground up, rather than from the
   top down. That is, the authors and others created a series of courses,
   both multi-disciplinary and disciplinary, a database, and a core course
   designed to make digital humanities a reality, even without having it
   certified as a program by the governing bodies of their faculty and
   university. In this article, the database and core course are described
   in some detail in order to offer what the authors believe to be
   worthwhile ideas to others who would advance the cause of digital
   humanities. The article concludes with some concrete suggestions on how
   to ensure support, to make faculty participation possible, to measure
   success, and to motivate students.}},

Title = {{As You Can See: Applying Visual Collaborative Filtering to Works of Art}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Art historically relevant visual knowledge can be deconstructed and the
   resulting components of this visual knowledge - visual discernments -
   lend themselves to be socially negotiated. Individual visual experts
   (like connoisseurs) do not share some grand and undividable cognitive
   cataloguing system; they are attentive to piecemeal visual discernments
   and the patterns in which these occur in reality. In conventional
   scholarly communication sophisticated tools to discuss perceptual
   patterns are lacking. This paper not only proposes a theoretical model
   of visual knowledge accumulation, but also describes a practical
   implementation, Art. Similarities, which is designed as a prototype of
   such a sophisticated tool. Using a custom-made interface it records
   visual behavior: the non-verbally expressed visual similarity judgments
   of distributed individuals. Users can be assigned to groups according to
   the qualities of their judgments. These qualities may be distilled from
   emerging similarity patterns. The implications of individual judgments
   in different user groups may vary considerably. Emerging patterns can be
   assessed both according to human analysis and statistical procedures.
   Most studies on art evaluation are attentive to either the
   characteristics of works, or the characteristics of observers. In this
   study both are considered as interdependent entities consistently.}},

   70s - and analyzed as responses to a range of cultural concerns specific
   to the digital age. The analysis identifies movement toward two terminal
   points: first, a mode of remix-based montage inspired by open source

   emergence of a mode of imaging termed the ``digital analogue{''}, which

Title = {{All Hope Abandon: Biblical Text and Interactive Fiction}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Among the alternative kinds of narrative opened up by computer
   technology, one of earliest is interactive fiction (and specifically the
   ``text adventure{''} or ``adventure game{''}), which first came into
   being in the 1970s. Text-based interactive fiction enjoyed a brief
   period of commercial success in the 1980s until it was overtaken by
   advances in computer graphics, but it continues to be read and written
   by enthusiastic amateurs. Although interactive fiction clearly has roots
   in computer gaming, it also has potential as a new form of literature.
   Since interactive fiction may be a medium unfamiliar to some readers,
   this article will start by defining it, explaining some of its
   conventions, and outlining its origins. It will then describe how one
   recent piece of interactive fiction, ``All Hope Abandon{''}, explores
   aspects of Biblical Studies through the medium of IF, and will end by
   suggesting a number of fruitful links between interactive fiction and
   biblical text. In the course of the article several examples from ``All
   Hope Abandon{''} will be given, and instructions on how to install and
   play the game will be provided at the end.}},

Title = {{The End of the Irrelevant Text: Electronic Texts, Linguistics, and
   Literary Theory}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{The close study of literary texts has a long and illustrious history.
   But the popularity of textual analysis has waned in recent decades, just
   at the time that widely available electronic texts were making
   traditional analytic tools easier to apply and encouraging the
   development of innovative computer-assisted tools. Without claiming any
   simple causal relationship, I argue that the marginalization of textual
   analysis and other text-centered approaches owes something to the
   dominance of Chomskyan linguistics and the popularity of high theory.
   Certainly both an introspective, sentence-oriented, formalist linguistic
   approach and literary theories deeply influenced by ideas about the
   sign's instability and the tendency of texts to disintegrate under
   critical pressure minimize the importance of the text. Using examples
   from Noam Chomsky, Jerome McGann, and Stanley Fish, I argue for a return
   to the text, specifically the electronic, computable text, to see what
   corpora, text-analysis, statistical stylistics, and authorship
   attribution can reveal about meanings and style. The recent resurgence
   of interest in scholarly editions, corpora, text-analysis, stylistics,
   and authorship suggest that the electronic text may finally reach its
   full potential.}},

Title = {{Somewhere Nearby is Colossal Cave: Examining Will Crowther's Original
   ``Adventure{''} in Code and in Kentucky}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Because so little primary historical work has been done on the classic
   text computer game ``Colossal Cave Adventure{''}, academic and popular
   references to it frequently perpetuate inaccuracies. ``Adventure{''} was
   the first in a series of text-based games ({''}interactive fiction{''})
   that emphasize exploring, puzzles, and story, typically in a fantasy
   setting; these games had a significant cultural impact in the late 1970s
   and a significant commercial presence in the early 1980s. Will Crowther
   based his program on a real cave in Kentucky; Don Woods expanded this
   version significantly. The expanded work has been examined as an
   occasion for narrative encounters {[}Buckles 1985] and as an aesthetic
   masterpiece of logic and utility {[}Knuth 1998]; however, previous
   attempts to assess the significance of ``Adventure{''} remain incomplete
   without access to Crowther's original source code and Crowther's
   original source cave. Accordingly, this paper analyzes previously
   unpublished files recovered from a backup of Woods's student account at
   Stanford, and documents an excursion to the real Colossal Cave in
   Kentucky in 2005. In addition, new interviews with Crowther, Woods, and
   their associates (particularly members of Crowther's family) provide new
   insights on the precise nature of Woods's significant contributions.
   Real locations in the cave and several artifacts (such as an iron rod
   and an axe head) correspond to their representation in Crowther's
   version; however, by May of 1977, Woods had expanded the game to include
   numerous locations that he invented, along with significant technical
   innovations (such as scorekeeping and a player inventory). Sources that
   incorrectly date Crowther's original to 1972 or 1974, or that identify
   it as a cartographic data file with no game or fantasy elements, are
   sourced thinly if at all. The new evidence establishes that Crowther
   wrote the game during the 1975-76 academic year and probably abandoned
   it in early 1976. The original game employed magic, humor, simple
   combat, and basic puzzles, all of which Woods greatly expanded. While
   Crowther remained largely faithful to the geography of the real cave,
   his original did introduce subtle changes to the environment in order to
   improve the gameplay.}},
